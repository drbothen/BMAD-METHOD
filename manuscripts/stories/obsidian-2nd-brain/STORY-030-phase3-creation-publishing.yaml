user_story: |
  As a knowledge worker
  I want AI agents to help me create content from my knowledge base and publish it externally
  So that I can share insights and generate creative outputs efficiently

acceptance_criteria: |
  **2 Additional Agents:**
  - Content Brief Agent: Gather context and prepare materials for content creation
  - Publication Formatter Agent: Format content for external publication

  **10 Additional Tasks:**
  - Creation: query-relevant-notes, query-temporal-context, organize-materials, identify-research-gaps, extract-quotable-passages, track-content-usage
  - Publishing: extract-publication-content, convert-wikilinks, generate-bibliography, check-privacy-compliance

  **2 Additional Templates:**
  - content-brief-tmpl.yaml
  - publication-manifest-tmpl.yaml

  **2 Additional Checklists:**
  - brief-completeness-checklist.md
  - publication-quality-checklist.md

  **2 Additional Workflows:**
  - creation-project-workflow
  - Feedback loop integration into knowledge-lifecycle-workflow

  Content Brief Agent Capabilities:
  - Query relevant notes using semantic search + temporal context
  - Organize materials into logical outline
  - Extract quotable passages with full attribution
  - Identify research gaps (what's missing from knowledge base)
  - Provide temporal context (how topic evolved)
  - Surface unique angles (cross-domain insights, contrarian takes)
  - Generate citation manifest (all source notes used)
  - Support multiple creation types (article, essay, presentation, video script, tweet thread)

  Publication Formatter Agent Capabilities:
  - Extract publication content from Obsidian notes
  - Convert wikilinks to target format (HTML, plain text, footnotes)
  - Generate bibliography from source metadata
  - Check privacy compliance (no private notes exposed)
  - Validate external links (ensure not broken)
  - Create publication manifest (provenance tracking)
  - Support multiple target formats (blog post, PDF, slides, epub)
  - Track usage in Neo4j (CreativeOutput nodes linking to source notes)

  Creation Workflow:
  1. User initiates creation project with topic
  2. Content Brief Agent queries knowledge base
  3. Agent identifies research gaps (optional: trigger Research Coordinator)
  4. Agent generates comprehensive brief
  5. User creates content using brief
  6. Publication Formatter Agent prepares for publication
  7. User reviews and publishes
  8. Feedback loop: User updates notes with creation insights

  Neo4j Provenance Tracking:
  - CreativeOutput nodes: Store publication metadata
  - [:USED_IN] relationships: Link notes to outputs
  - Enable queries: "What publications reference this note?"
  - Track concept reuse and impact

dependencies:
  - Phase 1 complete (query and retrieval functional)
  - Phase 2 complete (temporal context available)
  - Neo4j optional but recommended (for provenance tracking)

testing:
  - Generate content brief for technical article
  - Identify research gaps accurately
  - Extract quotable passages with attribution
  - Convert wikilinks to HTML
  - Generate bibliography
  - Test privacy compliance checking
  - Create publication manifest
  - Verify provenance tracking in Neo4j

definition_of_done:
  - Both agents implemented and tested
  - All 10 tasks created and validated
  - Both templates complete
  - Both checklists comprehensive
  - Both workflows functional
  - Provenance tracking working
  - Phase 3 testing complete
  - Documentation updated
