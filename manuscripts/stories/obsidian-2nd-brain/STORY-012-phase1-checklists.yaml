  As a developer
  I want to create validation checklists for Phase 1 workflows
  So that agents can enforce quality standards systematically

acceptance_criteria:
  - Create checklists/ directory
  - Create capture-quality-checklist.md
  - Create atomicity-checklist.md
  - Create linking-quality-checklist.md
  - Create query-completeness-checklist.md
  - Create audit-coverage-checklist.md
  - All checklists include items, pass criteria, and usage notes
  - Checklists specify required vs. optional items
  - Checklists include validation logic
