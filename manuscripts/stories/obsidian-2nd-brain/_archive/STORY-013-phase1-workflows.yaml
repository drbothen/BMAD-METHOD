user_story: |
  As a knowledge worker
  I want predefined workflows that orchestrate multiple agents
  So that I can execute complex knowledge management routines systematically

acceptance_criteria:
  - Create workflows/ directory
  - Create knowledge-lifecycle-workflow.yaml (basic version)
  - Create daily-capture-processing-workflow.yaml
  - Create weekly-review-workflow.yaml
  - All workflows specify phases, agents, tasks, and exit criteria
  - Workflows include duration estimates
  - Workflows reference agent commands and task dependencies

technical_notes: |
  Workflow 1: knowledge-lifecycle-workflow.yaml (basic)
  - Purpose: Orchestrate complete knowledge journey from capture through retrieval
  - Phases:
    1. Capture: Inbox Triage Agent
    2. Organization: Structural Analysis + Semantic Linker
    3. Periodic Review: Quality Auditor
  - Note: Phase 2 will add synthesis, Phase 3 creation, Phase 4 gap detection
  - Duration: Continuous (lifecycle)
  - Used by: All users as master workflow

  Workflow 2: daily-capture-processing-workflow.yaml
  - Purpose: Routine workflow for daily knowledge work
  - Schedule: Daily (morning and evening)
  - Morning Routine (10 min):
    1. Inbox Triage Agent: Process overnight captures
    2. Semantic Linker Agent: Review pending suggestions (5-10)
    3. Query Interpreter Agent: Surface relevant notes for day's work
  - Evening Routine (10 min):
    1. Inbox Triage Agent: Process day's captures
    2. Quality Auditor Agent: Quick freshness check (critical notes only)
  - Duration: 15-20 minutes total
  - Used by: Daily knowledge workers

  Workflow 3: weekly-review-workflow.yaml
  - Purpose: Weekly maintenance and synthesis
  - Schedule: Weekly (e.g., Sunday evening)
  - Steps (30-45 min total):
    1. Quality Auditor Agent: Run weekly audit (15 min)
       - Check for broken links
       - Identify stale notes (domain-critical only)
       - Report orphaned notes
    2. Semantic Linker Agent: Batch process link suggestions (15 min)
       - Review accumulated suggestions
       - Accept/reject in batch
    3. Query Interpreter Agent: Exploratory queries (15 min)
       - "What emerged this week?"
       - "What domains saw growth?"
  - Duration: 30-45 minutes
  - Used by: Weekly reviewers (GTD practitioners, etc.)

dependencies:
  - STORY-001: Expansion pack infrastructure
  - STORY-002: Inbox Triage Agent
  - STORY-003: Structural Analysis Agent
  - STORY-004: Semantic Linker Agent
  - STORY-005: Query Interpreter Agent
  - STORY-006: Quality Auditor Agent

testing:
  - Execute daily capture processing workflow (morning + evening)
  - Execute weekly review workflow end-to-end
  - Verify phase transitions and exit criteria
  - Test duration estimates (should be accurate ±20%)

definition_of_done:
  - All 3 workflow files created in workflows/
  - Workflows specify phases, agents, tasks, exit criteria
  - Duration estimates provided
  - Agent commands and task dependencies documented
  - Workflows tested end-to-end
  - Documentation added to user guide
