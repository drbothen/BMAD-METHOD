user_story: |
  As a user
  I want integrations with Obsidian task management plugins
  So that I can visualize, query, and manage tasks efficiently

acceptance_criteria: |
  **4 Obsidian Plugin Integrations:**
  1. Tasks plugin (primary - advanced task queries)
  2. Dataview plugin (task aggregation and reporting)
  3. Calendar plugin (deadline visualization)
  4. Kanban plugin (visual task board)

  **Integration Requirements:**
  - Installation guides for each plugin
  - Configuration guides for optimal settings
  - Query examples for common use cases
  - Template integration (use plugin-compatible formats)
  - Task format standardization (work with all plugins)
  - Workflow integration (agents use plugin features)

  Integration 1: Tasks Plugin
  Purpose: Advanced task management with GTD support

  Installation:
  1. Open Obsidian Settings → Community Plugins
  2. Browse and search for "Tasks"
  3. Install and enable "Tasks" by Martin Schenck
  4. Configure settings (see below)

  Configuration:
  ```
  Settings → Tasks:
  ✅ Auto-suggest task properties
  ✅ Set done date on every completed task
  ✅ Use filename as default task date
  ✅ Enable recurring tasks
  Date format: YYYY-MM-DD
  Global filter: (none - show all tasks)
  ```

  Task Format (Tasks plugin compatible):
  ```markdown
  - [ ] Task description 📅 2025-11-08 ⏫ #work @context
  - [ ] Task with recurrence 📅 2025-11-04 🔁 every week
  - [ ] Task with start date ⏳ 2025-11-01 📅 2025-11-08
  - [x] Completed task ✅ 2025-11-05
  ```

  Emoji Syntax:
  - 📅 Due date
  - ⏳ Start date
  - 🔁 Recurrence
  - ⏫ High priority
  - 🔼 Medium priority
  - 🔽 Low priority
  - ✅ Done date
  - #tag Tags
  - @context Context

  Query Examples:
  ````markdown
  # Tasks Due Today
  ```tasks
  not done
  due today
  sort by priority
  ```

  # High Priority Tasks
  ```tasks
  not done
  priority is high
  sort by due
  ```

  # Tasks by Context
  ```tasks
  not done
  description includes @work
  ```

  # Tasks for Project
  ```tasks
  not done
  path includes Projects/Web Portal
  sort by due
  ```

  # Overdue Tasks
  ```tasks
  not done
  due before today
  sort by due
  ```

  # Completed This Week
  ```tasks
  done this week
  sort by done
  ```

  # All Tasks Statistics
  ```tasks
  group by status
  ```
  ````

  Advanced Features:
  - Recurring tasks: `🔁 every day`, `🔁 every 2 weeks on Monday`, `🔁 every month on the 1st`
  - Relative dates: `due today`, `due tomorrow`, `due next week`
  - Date ranges: `due after 2025-11-01`, `due before 2025-12-01`
  - Task dependencies: Use custom format in description
  - Priority filters: `priority is high`, `priority is not low`
  - Multiple filters: Combine with `AND` logic

  Integration with Task Management Agent:
  - Agent generates tasks in Tasks plugin format
  - Agent uses emoji syntax for metadata
  - Agent creates task queries for reports
  - Agent supports recurring task patterns

  Integration 2: Dataview Plugin
  Purpose: Query and aggregate tasks using DataviewJS

  Installation:
  1. Open Obsidian Settings → Community Plugins
  2. Browse and search for "Dataview"
  3. Install and enable "Dataview" by Michael Brenan
  4. Enable JavaScript queries in settings

  Configuration:
  ```
  Settings → Dataview:
  ✅ Enable JavaScript queries
  ✅ Enable inline JavaScript queries
  ✅ Enable inline queries
  Date format: YYYY-MM-DD
  ```

  Task Queries with Dataview:
  ````markdown
  # All Tasks by Priority
  ```dataview
  TASK
  WHERE !completed
  GROUP BY priority
  SORT priority DESC
  ```

  # Project Task Summary
  ```dataview
  TABLE
    length(file.tasks) as "Total",
    length(filter(file.tasks, (t) => !t.completed)) as "Open",
    length(filter(file.tasks, (t) => t.completed)) as "Done"
  FROM "03-Projects"
  WHERE file.tasks
  SORT file.name
  ```

  # Tasks Due This Week
  ```dataview
  TASK
  WHERE !completed AND due >= date(today) AND due <= date(today) + dur(7 days)
  SORT due ASC
  ```
  ````

  Advanced DataviewJS Example:
  ````markdown
  # Weekly Task Statistics
  ```dataviewjs
  const tasks = dv.pages().file.tasks.where(t => t.completed);
  const thisWeek = tasks.where(t =>
    t.completion >= dv.date('2025-11-04') &&
    t.completion <= dv.date('2025-11-10')
  );

  dv.header(3, "Completed This Week: " + thisWeek.length);

  // Group by day
  const byDay = thisWeek.groupBy(t => t.completion);
  dv.table(
    ["Day", "Tasks Completed"],
    byDay.map(g => [g.key, g.rows.length])
  );
  ```
  ````

  Integration with Task Management Agent:
  - Agent can generate Dataview queries
  - Agent uses Dataview for statistics in weekly reviews
  - Agent formats task frontmatter for Dataview compatibility

  - Agent uses date format compatible with Calendar plugin
  - Daily todo lists appear in calendar view

  Daily Note Template:
  ```markdown

      tasks/                # Individual task notes
        TASK-123.md

  ```

  Integration with Task Management Agent:
  - Agent creates Kanban-compatible task format
  - Agent can generate project Kanban boards
  - Agent updates board when task status changes
  - Agent uses board columns for task status

  Unified Task Format:
  Compatible with all 4 plugins

  ```markdown
  - [ ] {{description}} @{{context}} 📅 {{deadline}} ⏫ #{{project}}
  ```

  Example:
  ```markdown

  ```

  This format works with:
  - ✅ Tasks plugin (emoji syntax)
  - ✅ Dataview (can query all fields)
  - ✅ Calendar (shows on deadline date)
  - ✅ Kanban (drag and drop)

  ---

  Query Library:
  Create `00-System/task-queries.md` with common queries

  ````markdown
  # Task Query Library
