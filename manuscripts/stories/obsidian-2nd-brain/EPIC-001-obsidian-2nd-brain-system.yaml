title: Obsidian 2nd Brain with Temporal RAG System
type: epic
priority: critical
estimated_effort: 18-24 weeks
target_phase: All Phases
created: 2025-11-04
status: planning

description: |
  Build a comprehensive BMAD expansion pack that transforms Obsidian into a powerful
  second brain with temporal RAG architecture. The system combines semantic search
  (Smart Connections) with temporal graph database (Neo4j + Graphiti MCP) to enable
  knowledge workers to store, retrieve, and understand how their thinking evolves over time.

business_value: |
  - First personal knowledge management system combining semantic search with bi-temporal graph database
  - Enables temporal queries: "How has my understanding of X evolved?"
  - Supports multiple methodologies: Zettelkasten, PARA, LYT, Johnny Decimal
  - 10+ specialized AI agents for complete knowledge lifecycle management
  - Quality assurance through 20+ validation checklists
  - Bridges personal knowledge base to public content creation

key_capabilities:
  - Intelligent capture and triage of web clips, highlights, and notes
  - Automatic atomicity analysis and note fragmentation
  - Semantic bidirectional linking
  - Map of Content (MOC) construction and maintenance
  - Natural language query across markdown and graph database
  - Temporal evolution analysis and narratives
  - Knowledge gap detection and research prioritization
  - Content brief generation for creation projects
  - Multi-source research with credibility assessment
  - Quality auditing and freshness tracking
  - Publication formatting with provenance tracking

technical_architecture:
  - Obsidian: Markdown vault with plugins (Smart Connections, MCP Tools, Local REST API)
  - Smart Connections: Local semantic search via BGE-micro-v2 embeddings
  - Neo4j + Graphiti: Bi-temporal graph database for evolution tracking
  - MCP Protocol: Integration layer for tool orchestration
  - BMAD Agents: 10+ specialized agents coordinating knowledge workflows

success_criteria:
  - 100+ active users within 3 months of release
  - 70%+ retention rate at 30 days
  - 90%+ notes meeting atomic standards
  - <5% orphaned notes
  - Net Promoter Score (NPS) > 50
  - Query response time < 3 seconds
  - Capture to inbox note < 30 seconds

implementation_phases:
  - phase: 1
    name: MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
    duration: 4-6 weeks
    focus: Core capture, organization, and retrieval workflows
    agents: 5 core agents
    stories: STORY-001 through STORY-030

  - phase: 2
    name: Enhanced Synthesis & Temporal Analysis
    duration: 3-4 weeks
    focus: MOC construction and temporal evolution tracking
    agents: 2 additional agents
    stories: STORY-031 through STORY-050

  - phase: 3
    name: Creation & Publishing
    duration: 3-4 weeks
    focus: Content creation and publication support
    agents: 2 additional agents
    stories: STORY-051 through STORY-065

  - phase: 4
    name: Advanced Analysis & Gap Detection
    duration: 2-3 weeks
    focus: Knowledge gap identification and research prioritization
    agents: 1 additional agent
    stories: STORY-066 through STORY-080

  - phase: 5
    name: Optional Research Integration (Enhanced)
    duration: 3-4 weeks
    focus: Adaptive external research with automatic tool detection
    agents: 1 optional agent (enhanced)
    stories: STORY-081 through STORY-110

  - phase: 6
    name: Polish & Documentation
    duration: 2-3 weeks
    focus: Complete documentation, optimization, and user onboarding
    agents: All agents refinement
    stories: STORY-111 through STORY-130

dependencies:
  - BMAD-METHOD core framework v4.x+
  - Obsidian v1.4.0+
  - Node.js v16+ (for MCP servers)
  - Docker (optional, for Neo4j)
  - OpenAI API access (for Graphiti entity extraction)

risks:
  - Complexity overwhelms users → Mitigation: Guided onboarding, Simple/Balanced/Advanced modes
  - Neo4j performance degradation at scale → Mitigation: Caching, query optimization, partitioning
  - Installation barriers → Mitigation: Obsidian-only mode, one-click installers, video tutorials
  - MCP protocol evolution → Mitigation: Follow spec updates, use stable API versions
