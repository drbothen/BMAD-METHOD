    - [ ] Define agent personality:
      - Systematic quality auditor
      - Research prioritization strategist
      - Completeness-focused analyst
      - Improvement-oriented advisor

  - [ ] Task 2: Define gap type taxonomy (AC2)
    - [ ] Gap Types:
      - **Coverage Gap**: Missing topic or domain entirely
        * Example: "We have notes on JavaScript but nothing on TypeScript"
        * Detection: Domain analysis reveals missing areas
        * Location: Usually cross_domain or foundational
      - **Evidence Gap**: Claims without sufficient support
        * Example: "Note claims X but provides no sources or data"
        * Detection: Citation analysis, source validation
        * Location: Within_notes
      - **Prerequisite Gap**: Missing foundational knowledge
        * Example: "Can't understand advanced topic without basics"
        * Detection: Concept dependency analysis
        * Location: Foundational
      - **Assumption Gap**: Implicit assumptions not examined
        * Example: "Argument relies on unstated premise P"
        * Detection: Logical analysis, argumentation structure
        * Location: Within_notes or methodological
      - **Conceptual Gap**: Incomplete or shallow understanding
        * Example: "Surface-level note without deep exploration"
        * Detection: Depth analysis, question identification
        * Location: Within_notes
    - [ ] Gap Locations:
      - **Within Notes**: Missing content in individual notes
      - **Cross Domain**: Missing connections between domains
      - **Foundational**: Missing basic concepts or frameworks
      - **Methodological**: Missing research or analysis methods

  - [ ] Task 3: Define automated gap detection methods (AC3)
    - [ ] Automated Detection Techniques:
      - **Unresolved Question Detection**:
        * Search for: ?, TODO, RESEARCH, INVESTIGATE markers
        * Parse note content for question marks
        * Identify explicit TODOs
        * Extract research requests
      - **Undeveloped Concept Detection**:
        * Stub notes (<100 words)
        * Low link density (<2 links)
        * No sources cited
        * Created but never updated (>6 months old, last_modified = created)
      - **Missing Prerequisite Detection**:
        * Dependency analysis (advanced concepts without basics)
        * Follow concept hierarchies
        * Identify "jumped ahead" patterns
      - **Evidence Gap Detection**:
        * Claims without sources (assertions lacking citations)
        * Arguments without supporting notes
        * Comparisons without data
      - **Domain Boundary Detection**:
        * Unexplored adjacent areas (MOC shows related domains missing)
        * Incomplete domain coverage (MOC has emerging questions)
    - [ ] Detection Frequency:
      - Monthly Deep Review: Full vault scan
      - Content Brief Creation: Topic-specific scan
      - Contradiction Resolution: Context-specific scan
      - User request: On-demand scan

  - [ ] Task 4: Define gap priority calculation (AC4)
    - [ ] Priority Scoring Formula:
      ```
      Importance Score = (Blocking Work Count × 50) + (Reference Count × 10) + (Domain Centrality × 20)
      Feasibility Score = Accessible Sources + (1 / Estimated Hours) + Expertise Match
      Net Priority = Importance / Feasibility
      ```
    - [ ] Importance Factors:
      - **Blocking Work Count**: How many projects/outputs wait on gap resolution
        * Critical: ≥3 blocking items → +150 points
        * High: 1-2 blocking items → +50-100 points
        * Low: 0 blocking items → +0 points
      - **Reference Count**: How often gap appears in notes
        * High: ≥10 references → +100 points
        * Medium: 5-9 references → +50 points
        * Low: 1-4 references → +10-40 points
      - **Domain Centrality**: Importance within domain
        * Central concept: Core to domain → +100 points
        * Supporting concept: Enriches domain → +40 points
        * Peripheral concept: Nice to have → +10 points
    - [ ] Feasibility Factors:
      - **Accessible Sources**: Can info be found?
        * Easy: Authoritative sources readily available → High feasibility
        * Moderate: Sources exist but require access → Medium feasibility
        * Hard: Sources scarce or non-existent → Low feasibility
      - **Estimated Hours**: Time to fill gap
        * Quick: <2 hours → High feasibility
        * Medium: 2-8 hours → Medium feasibility
        * Long: >8 hours → Low feasibility
      - **Expertise Match**: Do you have background?
        * Match: Within expertise → High feasibility
        * Stretch: Learnable → Medium feasibility
        * Gap: Outside expertise → Low feasibility
    - [ ] Priority Levels:
      - **Critical**: Net Priority ≥ 90 (high importance, high feasibility)
      - **High**: Net Priority 70-89
      - **Medium**: Net Priority 40-69
      - **Low**: Net Priority 0-39

  - [ ] Task 5: Define gap analysis creation process (AC5, AC6)
    - [ ] Gap Analysis Creation:
      1. Detect or receive gap report
      2. Classify gap type (coverage/evidence/prerequisite/assumption/conceptual)
      3. Identify gap location (within_notes/cross_domain/foundational/methodological)
      4. Collect context:
         - Where gap appears (specific notes)
         - Why gap matters (impact assessment)
         - Blocking work (projects waiting on resolution)
      5. Calculate priority score:
         - Importance factors (blocking work, references, centrality)
         - Feasibility factors (sources, hours, expertise)
         - Net priority
      6. Suggest research approach:
         - Recommended methods (reading, experimentation, consultation)
         - Potential sources (books, experts, datasets)
         - Estimated effort (hours or days)
         - Required expertise level
      7. Define success criteria:
         - Questions that should be answerable
         - Artifacts that should exist (notes, data)
         - Validation method
      8. Load gap-analysis-tmpl.yaml template
      9. Populate gap analysis sections
      10. Validate using gap-identification-checklist.md
      11. Validate using prioritization-checklist.md
      12. Save gap analysis
    - [ ] Output:
      - Gap analysis markdown file
      - Priority score
      - Research approach
      - Success criteria

      - ✓ Net priority = Importance / (Feasibility × Hours)
      - Blocking work count accurate
      - ✓ Domain centrality score justified
      - ✓ Research method appropriate for gap type
      - Quick wins identified (high value, low effort)
      - Dependencies respected (prerequisite gaps prioritized)
      - Research capacity considered
    - [ ] Quality Thresholds:
      - Pass criteria: All required items (✓) checked
      - Warn if priority score unjustified
      - Warn if research approach infeasible
      - Block if gap description unclear

  - [ ] Task 7: Define research queue management (AC8)
    - [ ] Research Priority Queue:
      - Gaps sorted by net priority (descending)
      - Critical gaps (≥90) at top
      - High gaps (70-89) next
      - Medium gaps (40-69) after
      - Low gaps (0-39) last
    - [ ] Queue Optimization:
      - **Dependency Ordering**: Prerequisite gaps before dependent gaps
      - **Quick Wins**: High-value, low-effort gaps highlighted
      - **Blocking Work**: Gaps blocking projects prioritized
      - **Capacity Allocation**: Time allocated per gap
    - [ ] Research Roadmap:
      - Sequence gaps based on dependencies
      - Estimate timeline (weeks or months)
      - Identify parallel research opportunities
      - Plan research phases
    - [ ] Queue Templates:
      - Use research-priority-tmpl.yaml (from STORY-034)
      - Priority ranking
      - Research roadmap
      - Capacity allocation
      - Quick wins list

  - [ ] Task 8: Define gap lifecycle tracking (AC9)
    - [ ] Gap Status Lifecycle:
      - **Identified**: Gap discovered and documented
        * Gap analysis created
        * Priority assigned
        * Research approach suggested
      - **Researching**: Active research in progress
        * Research initiated
        * Sources being consulted
        * Progress notes being added
      - **Researched**: Research completed, integration pending
        * Sufficient information gathered
        * Ready for integration into KB
        * Notes to be created from findings
      - **Closed**: Gap filled and integrated
        * Notes created from research
        * Links established
        * Original gap-analysis archived or updated
    - [ ] Status Transitions:
      - Identified → Researching: Research Coordinator starts research
      - Researching → Researched: Research findings complete
      - Researched → Closed: Notes integrated into KB
    - [ ] Gap Tracking:
      - Frontmatter status field updated
      - Neo4j gap nodes updated (if enabled)
      - Research progress logged
      - Closed date recorded

  - [ ] Task 9: Define contradiction-driven gap detection (AC10)
    - [ ] Contradiction Resolution Integration:
      - Contradiction Resolution Workflow (Strategy B: Accept Both) creates gaps
      - When contradiction unresolvable due to missing knowledge:
        * Create gap analysis
        * Type: assumption or conceptual gap
        * Priority: High (contradiction blocks understanding)
        * Research approach: Investigate missing context
      - Link gap to contradiction record
      - Resolve gap before resolving contradiction
    - [ ] Contradiction-Driven Gap Structure:
      ```yaml
      gap_type: assumption
      trigger: contradiction_resolution
      contradiction_id: "contra-123"
      contradictory_claims:
        - "[[Note A]]: Claims X"
        - "[[Note B]]: Claims not-X"
      missing_knowledge: "Understanding of context C needed to resolve"
      research_approach: "Investigate context C to determine which claim valid"
      ```
    - [ ] Integration Flow:
      1. Contradiction detected (Semantic Linker)
      2. Resolution attempted (Contradiction Resolution Workflow)
      3. If Strategy B (Accept Both): Create gap for missing context
      4. Gap Detector creates gap analysis
      5. Research Coordinator fills gap
      6. Contradiction Resolution Workflow resumes

  - [ ] Task 10: Define Neo4j gap tracking (optional) (AC9)
    - [ ] Neo4j Gap Node Structure:
      ```cypher
      CREATE (gap:Gap {
        id: "uuid",
        type: "evidence",
        location: "within_notes",
        priority: "high",
        status: "identified",
        discovery_date: "2025-11-05",
        priority_score: 85,
        importance: 120,
        feasibility: 0.7,
        estimated_hours: 4
      })

      // Link to notes where gap appears
      MATCH (note:Note {id: "note-123"})
      CREATE (note)-[:HAS_GAP]->(gap)

      // Link to blocking work
      MATCH (project:Project {id: "proj-456"})
      CREATE (gap)-[:BLOCKS]->(project)

      // Track research progress
      MATCH (gap:Gap {id: "uuid"})
      SET gap.status = "researching"
      SET gap.research_started = "2025-11-06"

      // Close gap
      MATCH (gap:Gap {id: "uuid"})
      MATCH (note:Note {id: "note-789"})
      CREATE (note)-[:FILLS_GAP]->(gap)
      SET gap.status = "closed"
      SET gap.closed_date = "2025-11-07"

      // Query priority queue
      MATCH (gap:Gap {status: "identified"})
      RETURN gap
      ORDER BY gap.priority_score DESC
      ```
    - [ ] Provenance Tracking:
      - Record gap discovery events
      - Track research progress
      - Link to filled notes

  - [ ] Task 11: Define dependencies and integration points (AC10)
    - [ ] Dependencies:
      - Tasks: detect-gaps, calculate-gap-priority, create-gap-analysis, manage-research-queue
      - Templates: gap-analysis-tmpl.yaml, research-priority-tmpl.yaml
      - Checklists: gap-identification-checklist.md, prioritization-checklist.md, contradiction-resolution-checklist.md
      - Data: Gap taxonomy, priority rubric
    - [ ] Integration Points:
      - **Monthly Deep Review Workflow**: Triggers full gap detection
      - **Content Brief Agent**: Detects gaps during brief creation (detect-brief-gaps)
      - **Research Coordinator Agent**: Fills identified gaps
      - **Contradiction Resolution Workflow**: Creates gaps for missing knowledge (Strategy B)
      - **MOC Constructor Agent**: MOCs reveal domain coverage gaps
      - **Structural Analysis Agent**: Detects undeveloped concepts
      - **Query Interpreter**: Users can query for gap lists
      - **Neo4j**: Gap tracking and priority queries (optional)

  - [ ] Task 12: Define agent constraints and best practices (AC10)
    - [ ] Constraints:
      - Gap description must be clear (≥100 chars)
      - Gap type must be valid (coverage/evidence/prerequisite/assumption/conceptual)
      - Priority calculation must use standard formula
      - Success criteria must be defined
      - Research approach must be feasible
    - [ ] Best Practices:
      - Run full gap detection monthly (during Deep Review)
      - Prioritize gaps blocking active work (critical priority)
      - Focus on quick wins (high value, low effort)
      - Respect dependencies (fill prerequisite gaps first)
      - Track gap lifecycle (don't lose track of identified gaps)
      - Close feedback loop (mark gaps closed when filled)
      - Review research queue quarterly (reprioritize)
    - [ ] Anti-Patterns to Avoid:
      - Creating gap analyses for every minor question (focus on significant gaps)
      - Not prioritizing gaps (unmanaged queue becomes overwhelming)
      - Ignoring blocking work (projects stall)
      - Not tracking status (lose visibility into progress)
      - Skipping feasibility assessment (pursue infeasible research)
      - Not closing gaps (gap list grows indefinitely)

  ## Gap Detection Philosophy

  Gap detection is **systematic KB quality improvement**:
  - Not ad-hoc "I wonder about X" (that's research interest, not gap)
  - Structured identification (what's missing that matters)
  - Priority-based (what to research first)
  - Lifecycle-managed (tracked from identification to closure)

  ## Gap vs Research Interest

  **Gap**: Missing knowledge that **impairs current work or understanding**
  - Blocks content creation
  - Prevents argument completion
  - Creates contradictions
  - Leaves assumptions unexamined

  **Research Interest**: Curious about something, but **not blocking**
  - "I'd like to learn about X someday"
  - No current impact on work
  - Low priority

  Create gap analyses for gaps, not research interests.

  ## Priority Calculation Rationale

  **Why this formula?**
  ```
  Net Priority = Importance / Feasibility
  ```

  - **Importance**: Why does this gap matter? (blocking work, references, centrality)
  - **Feasibility**: Can we realistically fill this gap? (sources, time, expertise)
  - **Net Priority**: Value divided by cost

  **High net priority = high value, low cost** (do these first!)

  ## Quick Wins Strategy

  Quick wins are **high-priority gaps with low effort**:
  - High importance (≥70 points)
  - Low effort (<2 hours)
  - Net priority ≥ 90

  Quick wins provide:
  - Immediate value (unblock work)
  - Momentum (visible progress)
  - Motivation (easy wins encourage more research)

  Always prioritize quick wins in research queue.

  ## Dependency Management

  Some gaps depend on others:
  - **Prerequisite Gap**: Must fill basic concepts before advanced
  - **Methodological Gap**: Must establish method before applying it
  - **Foundational Gap**: Must understand foundation before building on it

  Research queue must respect dependencies: **fill prerequisite gaps first**.

  ## Contradiction-Driven Gaps

  Contradictions often reveal **missing knowledge**:
  - Note A: "X is true"
  - Note B: "X is false"
  - Why contradiction? **Missing context C** that reconciles them

  Contradiction Resolution Strategy B (Accept Both) creates gap:
  - Gap type: assumption or conceptual
  - Research needed: Investigate context C
  - Once gap filled, contradiction often resolves

  ## Gap Lifecycle Importance

  Track gap lifecycle to:
  - **Maintain visibility**: Don't lose track of identified gaps
  - **Measure progress**: How many gaps closed per month?
  - **Prevent duplication**: Don't create duplicate gap analyses
  - **Enable reporting**: Show KB improvement over time

  Update gap status in frontmatter and Neo4j (if enabled).

  ## Integration with Research Workflow

  Gap Detector feeds directly into Research Coordinator:
  1. Gap identified → Gap analysis created
  2. Gap prioritized → Added to research queue
  3. Research initiated → Status: "researching"
  4. Research completed → Research Integration Workflow triggered
  5. Findings integrated → Gap status: "closed"

  This creates **closed-loop quality improvement**: detect → prioritize → research → integrate → close.

  ## Neo4j Gap Tracking Benefits

  Neo4j enables:
  - **Priority queries**: "Show all critical gaps"
  - **Blocking work queries**: "Which gaps block project X?"
  - **Dependency queries**: "Which gaps depend on gap Y?"
  - **Progress tracking**: "How many gaps closed this month?"
  - **Domain coverage**: "Which domains have most gaps?"

  If Neo4j enabled, use it for gap management.

  # Knowledge Gap: Loss Function Design Principles

  ## Knowledge Gap Description
  Our notes on loss functions explain what they are and provide examples (MSE, cross-entropy), but lack **design principles** for choosing or creating custom loss functions. This creates uncertainty when starting new ML projects: "Which loss function should I use? How do I know if I need a custom loss?"

  ## Why This Gap Matters
  **Impact on current work**:
  - Blocks content creation: Article "Loss Functions Explained" incomplete without design principles
  - Limits project work: Upcoming computer vision project may need custom loss, but no framework for deciding

  **Potential insights if gap filled**:
  - Systematic loss function selection (decision tree or rubric)
  - Understanding when/why to create custom losses
  - Avoiding poor loss function choices that hurt model performance

  **Risks of leaving gap unaddressed**:
  - Suboptimal loss function choices in projects
  - Incomplete article (reduced credibility)
  - Trial-and-error approach (inefficient)

  ## Where Gap Appears
  - [[Loss Functions]]: Lists examples but no design principles
  - [[Project: Custom Loss for Segmentation]]: Created custom loss but process was ad-hoc
  - [[Content Brief: ML as Optimization]]: Wants to discuss loss design but lacks source material

  ## Suggested Research Approach
  **Methods**:
  - Read: "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow (Chapter 6.2 on loss functions)
  - Read: "Loss Function Engineering" papers (search arXiv)
  - Consult: ML practitioners who design custom losses

  **Potential sources**:
  - Goodfellow et al., "Deep Learning" (MIT Press, 2016)
  - arXiv papers on loss function design
  - Blog posts from practitioners (distill.pub, colah.github.io)

  **Estimated effort**: 4 hours
  - 2 hours reading Goodfellow Chapter 6.2
  - 1 hour reading 2-3 arXiv papers
  - 1 hour synthesizing into notes

  **Required expertise level**: Intermediate ML (have background, extending knowledge)

  ## Success Criteria
  **Questions that should be answerable**:
  - How do I choose a loss function for a new ML problem?
  - When should I create a custom loss vs use standard losses?
  - What properties make a loss function effective?

  **Artifacts that should exist**:
  - [[Loss Function Design Principles]] note
  - [[Loss Function Selection Rubric]] note
  - Updates to [[Loss Functions]] with design principles section

  **Validation method**:
  - Can use rubric to select loss for new projects
  - Article "Loss Functions Explained" includes design principles section
  - Next custom loss creation is systematic, not ad-hoc

  ## Related Gaps
  - **Depends on**: None (foundational gap, no dependencies)
  - **Blocks**: None identified (but would improve future work)
  - **Related**: "[[Gap: Model Architecture Design Principles]]" (similar design frameworks needed)
