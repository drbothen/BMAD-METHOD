  - Multiple distinct concepts in one note
  - Excessive length (>2000 words)
  - Different temporal contexts mixed
  - Unrelated link clusters

  ### knowledge-building-blocks.md
  The 6 Zettelkasten building blocks:

  **Fleeting → Literature → Permanent Workflow:**
  ```
  1. Capture (Fleeting)
     - Quick inbox capture
     - Minimal processing
     - Lifespan: hours to days

  2. Process (Literature)
     - Extract ideas from sources
     - Add attribution
     - Lifespan: indefinite (if valuable)

  3. Synthesize (Permanent)
     - Combine multiple sources
     - Express in own words
     - Create atomic notes
     - Lifespan: indefinite (evergreen)

  4. Organize (MOCs)
     - Curate related notes
     - Provide overviews
     - Maintain as KB grows

  5. Execute (Projects)
     - Time-bound work
     - Draw on permanent notes
     - Archive when done

  6. Navigate (Index)
     - Entry points
     - Category organization
     - Maintain structure
  ```

  ## Linking & Semantics Knowledge Bases (2)

  ### link-relationship-types.md
  Complete relationship taxonomy:

  **Neo4j Relationship Types:**
  ```cypher
  // Semantic relationships
  CREATE (a)-[:SUPPORTS {strength: 0.9, confidence: 0.85}]->(b)
  CREATE (a)-[:CONTRADICTS {severity: "high", context: "temporal"}]->(b)
  CREATE (a)-[:ELABORATES {aspect: "implementation"}]->(b)

  // Hierarchical relationships
  CREATE (specific)-[:SPECIALIZES {domain: "ML"}]->(general)
  CREATE (prereq)-[:PREREQUISITE_OF {critical: true}]->(advanced)

  // Temporal relationships
  CREATE (new)-[:SUPERSEDES {date: "2025-11-05"}]->(old)
  CREATE (effect)-[:INFLUENCED {degree: 0.8}]->(cause)

  // Creative relationships
  CREATE (creation)-[:SYNTHESIZED_IN {type: "article"}]->(notes)
  CREATE (idea)-[:INSPIRED_BY {date: "2025-10-15"}]->(source)
  ```

  **Relationship Inference Rules:**
  - If A SUPPORTS B and B SUPPORTS C, suggest A may support C
  - If A CONTRADICTS B and B SUPPORTS C, flag A-C conflict
  - If A PREREQUISITE_OF B and B PREREQUISITE_OF C, chain A→B→C

  ### semantic-patterns.md
  Similarity detection and linking:

  **Similarity Thresholds:**
  - **0.95-1.0: Duplicates**
    - Action: Merge or deduplicate
    - User notification: Required

  - **0.85-0.95: Highly Related**
    - Action: Suggest strong link
    - Relationship: ELABORATES or SUPPORTS

  - **0.70-0.85: Related**
    - Action: Suggest link
    - Relationship: LINKED_TO with semantic tag

  - **0.50-0.70: Somewhat Related**
    - Action: Consider link if relevant
    - Relationship: Weak LINKED_TO

  **Pattern Detection:**
  - Complementary: Notes that fill each other's gaps
  - Sequential: Logical progression (A→B→C)
  - Hierarchical: General concept with specific instances
  - Contradictory: Conflicting claims (require resolution)

  ## Quality & Analysis Knowledge Bases (2)

  ### gap-detection-patterns.md
  Systematic gap identification:

  **Automated Detection Queries:**
  ```
  # Unresolved questions
  SEARCH: "?" OR "TODO" OR "RESEARCH"

  # Stub notes
  WHERE word_count < 200 AND link_count < 2

  # Missing prerequisites
  FIND notes referencing concepts not in KB

  # Evidence gaps
  WHERE claims_count > 0 AND sources_count = 0

  # Domain boundaries
  ANALYZE MOC structure for missing adjacent areas

  # Orphan clusters
  WHERE link_count < 2 AND not in MOC
  ```

  **Gap Severity Scoring:**
  ```
  Severity = (blocking_work_count * 50) + (reference_count * 10)
  Adjust for domain importance (×1.5 for critical domains)
  Adjust for research feasibility (÷ estimated_hours)
  ```

  ### contradiction-patterns.md
  Contradiction types and resolution:

  **Factual Contradiction Example:**
  - Note A: "React was released in 2013"
  - Note B: "React was released in 2011"
  - Resolution: Research → Accept A (2013 correct, 2011 was internal release)

  **Definitional Contradiction Example:**
  - Note A: "Atomic note = single concept"
  - Note B: "Atomic note = <500 words"
  - Resolution: Strategy E (Synthesize: Atomic notes have single concept AND are typically <500 words, but concept boundary matters more than length)

  **Contextual Contradiction Example:**
  - Note A: "Microservices are better than monoliths"
  - Note B: "Monoliths are better than microservices"
  - Resolution: Strategy A (Both true in different contexts: microservices for scale, monoliths for simplicity)

  ## Integration Patterns

  **Agent Knowledge Base Dependencies:**
  - **Research Coordinator Agent**: 6 research KBs (all research operations)
  - **Content Brief Agent**: 1 KB (content-type-taxonomy)
  - **Structural Analysis Agent**: 2 KBs (atomicity, building-blocks)
  - **Semantic Linker Agent**: 3 KBs (link-relationships, semantic-patterns, contradiction-patterns)
  - **Gap Detector Agent**: 2 KBs (gap-detection, contradiction-patterns)

  ## KB Maintenance

  **Versioning Strategy:**
  - v1.0: Initial KB creation
  - v1.x: Minor updates (examples, clarifications)
  - v2.0: Major revisions (new frameworks, patterns)

  **Update Triggers:**
  - New research tools available
  - Patterns emerge from usage
  - Quality standards evolve
  - Agent capabilities expand

dependencies:
  - Research Coordinator Agent (uses all 6 research KBs)
  - Content Brief Agent (uses content-type-taxonomy)
  - Structural Analysis Agent (uses atomicity-principles, knowledge-building-blocks)
  - Semantic Linker Agent (uses link-relationship-types, semantic-patterns, contradiction-patterns)
  - Gap Detector Agent (uses gap-detection-patterns, contradiction-patterns)
  - Perplexity MCP integration (referenced in research KBs)
  - Context7 MCP integration (referenced in research KBs)
  - Neo4j integration (relationship types) - optional

testing:
  - Validate markdown formatting for all 13 KBs
  - Test research-tools-catalog with actual tool detection
  - Verify credibility-scoring-rubric calculations
  - Test query-optimization patterns with sample queries
  - Validate atomicity-principles scoring
  - Test link-relationship-types with Neo4j queries
  - Verify semantic-patterns thresholds
  - Test gap-detection-patterns with sample gaps
  - Validate contradiction-patterns resolution strategies
  - Verify integration with respective agents
  - Test KB cross-references (internal consistency)
  - Validate examples in all KBs
