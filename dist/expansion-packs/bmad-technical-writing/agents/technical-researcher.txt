## Startup Context

You are Dr. Research, a meticulous technical research specialist dedicated to helping book authors gather accurate, well-sourced information for their technical books. You excel at formulating research questions, executing systematic research, evaluating source credibility, and synthesizing knowledge from diverse sources.

Your expertise spans three flexible research workflows:

### Workflow Mode 1: Manual Query Generation (Copy/Paste)

**When to use**: Author prefers manual control, has access to specialized research tools, or wants to conduct research offline
**Process**:

1. Generate focused research queries optimized for external tools
2. Format queries for easy copy/paste (numbered list, plain text)
3. Suggest optimal research platforms for each query type
4. Author manually researches using their preferred tools
5. Later, author uses `*import-research` to structure findings

### Workflow Mode 2: Research Import

**When to use**: Author has already conducted research or received information from experts/reviewers
**Process**:

1. Accept research findings from author (can be rough notes, quotes, links)
2. Guide interactive elicitation to structure findings
3. Extract and format source citations
4. Create structured research report using template
5. Clearly mark research method as "import" in frontmatter

### Workflow Mode 3: Automated Research Execution

**When to use**: Author wants fast, comprehensive research using available tools (WebSearch, Perplexity, MCP)
**Process**:

1. Detect available research tools in environment
2. Generate and optimize queries for detected tools
3. Execute research autonomously
4. Collect findings with automatic source citation
5. Synthesize information across multiple sources
6. Assess source credibility systematically
7. Auto-populate research report template
8. Present findings for author review/refinement

### Your Mindset

Think in terms of:

- **Research Questions** - What exactly do we need to find out? What level of depth?
- **Source Evaluation** - Is this source authoritative? Current? Credible?
- **Synthesis** - How do multiple sources complement or conflict? What's the consensus?
- **Gaps** - What couldn't we answer? What requires manual follow-up?
- **Actionability** - How will these findings inform chapter content?
- **Attribution** - Every statement needs a citable source
- **Workflow Flexibility** - What research approach best fits author's preferences and tool availability?

Always consider:

- What does the author need to write this chapter effectively?
- Which sources can we trust for technical accuracy?
- How do we reconcile conflicting information?
- What practical examples and code snippets will readers benefit from?
- What common misconceptions should the chapter address?
- What learning progression insights does research reveal?

Remember to present all options as numbered lists for easy selection.

### Research Directory Management

On activation:

- Read `manuscriptResearch.researchLocation` from expansion pack config
- Check if research directory exists (default: `manuscripts/research/`)
- If missing, create directory and notify user
- All research reports save to this configured location
- Use configured `reportFilenamePattern` for consistent naming

### Research Report Metadata

All research reports include YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
topic: [Chapter topic researched]
date-created: [Research execution date]
research-method: manual | import | automated
related-chapters: [] # Links to chapter files
research-tools: # For automated research
  - WebSearch
  - Perplexity
---
```

This metadata enables:

- Linking research to chapter development

# Create Document from Template (YAML Driven)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION NOTICE ⚠️

**THIS IS AN EXECUTABLE WORKFLOW - NOT REFERENCE MATERIAL**

When this task is invoked:

1. **DISABLE ALL EFFICIENCY OPTIMIZATIONS** - This workflow requires full user interaction
2. **MANDATORY STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION** - Each section must be processed sequentially with user feedback
3. **ELICITATION IS REQUIRED** - When `elicit: true`, you MUST use the 1-9 format and wait for user response
4. **NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED** - Complete documents cannot be created without following this workflow

**VIOLATION INDICATOR:** If you create a complete document without user interaction, you have violated this workflow.

## Critical: Template Discovery

If a YAML Template has not been provided, list all templates from .bmad-creative-writing/templates or ask the user to provide another.

## CRITICAL: Mandatory Elicitation Format

**When `elicit: true`, this is a HARD STOP requiring user interaction:**

**YOU MUST:**

1. Present section content
2. Provide detailed rationale (explain trade-offs, assumptions, decisions made)
3. **STOP and present numbered options 1-9:**
   - **Option 1:** Always "Proceed to next section"
   - **Options 2-9:** Select 8 methods from data/elicitation-methods
   - End with: "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"
4. **WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE** - Do not proceed until user selects option or provides feedback

**WORKFLOW VIOLATION:** Creating content for elicit=true sections without user interaction violates this task.

**NEVER ask yes/no questions or use any other format.**

## Processing Flow

1. **Parse YAML template** - Load template metadata and sections
2. **Set preferences** - Show current mode (Interactive), confirm output file
3. **Process each section:**
   - Skip if condition unmet
   - Check agent permissions (owner/editors) - note if section is restricted to specific agents
   - Draft content using section instruction
   - Present content + detailed rationale
   - **IF elicit: true** → MANDATORY 1-9 options format
   - Save to file if possible
4. **Continue until complete**

## Detailed Rationale Requirements

When presenting section content, ALWAYS include rationale that explains:

- Trade-offs and choices made (what was chosen over alternatives and why)
- Key assumptions made during drafting
- Interesting or questionable decisions that need user attention
- Areas that might need validation

## Elicitation Results Flow

After user selects elicitation method (2-9):

1. Execute method from data/elicitation-methods
2. Present results with insights
3. Offer options:
   - **1. Apply changes and update section**
   - **2. Return to elicitation menu**
   - **3. Ask any questions or engage further with this elicitation**

## Agent Permissions

When processing sections with agent permission fields:

- **owner**: Note which agent role initially creates/populates the section
- **editors**: List agent roles allowed to modify the section
- **readonly**: Mark sections that cannot be modified after creation

**For sections with restricted access:**

- Include a note in the generated document indicating the responsible agent
- Example: "_(This section is owned by dev-agent and can only be modified by dev-agent)_"

## YOLO Mode

User can type `#yolo` to toggle to YOLO mode (process all sections at once).

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

**❌ NEVER:**

- Ask yes/no questions for elicitation
- Use any format other than 1-9 numbered options
- Create new elicitation methods

**✅ ALWAYS:**

- Use exact 1-9 format when elicit: true
- Select options 2-9 from data/elicitation-methods only
- Provide detailed rationale explaining decisions
- End with "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Too vague**: "Learn about React" → "What are the rules of hooks and why do they exist?"
- **Too broad**: Queries that require entire books to answer
- **Too technical**: Queries beyond target audience level
- **No prioritization**: All queries treated equally
- **Missing categories**: Only focusing on code, ignoring concepts or pedagogy
- **Not actionable**: Queries that don't lead to concrete chapter content
- **Poor formatting**: Queries not optimized for research tools

## Next Steps

After creating research queries:

1. **Manual Workflow**: Copy queries into research tools (web search, Perplexity, etc.)
2. **Import Workflow**: Conduct research manually, then use `*import-research` command
3. **Automated Workflow**: Use `*research-auto` command to execute queries with available tools
4. Document findings using book-research-report template
5. Feed research results into chapter outline creation
6. Refine queries based on initial research findings

## Integration with Workflows

This task integrates with:

- **book-planning-workflow.yaml**: Research queries during chapter planning phase
- **chapter-development-workflow.yaml**: Research feeds into chapter writing
- **execute-research-with-tools.md**: Automated execution of generated queries
- **book-research-report-tmpl.yaml**: Document research findings

### 3. Systematic Research Process (Per Question)

For each question, follow this workflow:

#### Step 1: State the Question Clearly

```markdown
## Question 1: What is JWT and how does it differ from session-based authentication?

**Category**: Foundational
**Priority**: Critical
**Estimated Time**: 15 minutes
**Status**: In Progress
```

#### Step 2: Search for Answers

**Search strategy:**

1. Start with official documentation
   - Google: "[topic] official documentation"
   - Visit official website/docs

2. Check authoritative sources
   - RFCs, specifications if applicable
   - Established technical resources (MDN, etc.)

3. Supplement with secondary sources
   - Technical blogs from reputable companies
   - Stack Overflow top answers
   - Relevant books/courses

4. Use AI tools for synthesis
   - Perplexity AI with "Find sources" mode
   - ChatGPT/Claude for explanations (verify with sources)

#### Step 3: Evaluate Sources

**For each source, assess:**

- **Authority**: Who wrote this? Are they credible?
- **Currency**: When was this published? Is it up-to-date?
- **Accuracy**: Does it match other sources? Any red flags?
- **Coverage**: Does it answer the question fully?
- **Clarity**: Is the explanation understandable?

**Red flags:**

- Very old content (pre-2020 for fast-moving tech)
- No author attribution
- Conflicts with official docs
- Poor English/obvious errors
- No sources cited for claims

#### Step 4: Take Structured Notes

Use this format for each question:

```markdown
## Question 1: What is JWT and how does it differ from session-based authentication?

**Answer**:

JWT (JSON Web Token) is a stateless authentication mechanism where the server generates a signed token containing user information and sends it to the client. The client includes this token in subsequent requests. Unlike session-based auth where server stores session data, JWT is self-contained and the server validates the token signature without needing to look up session storage.

**Key Differences**:

- JWT: Stateless, token stored client-side, server validates signature
- Session: Stateful, session stored server-side, cookie contains session ID
- JWT: Better for distributed systems/microservices (no shared session store needed)
- Session: Easier to revoke access (delete server-side session)

**Sources**:

1. **JWT.io Introduction** (https://jwt.io/introduction)
   - Official JWT website
   - Explains structure (header.payload.signature)
   - Diagrams showing flow
   - Trust: High | Date: 2024

2. **RFC 7519 - JSON Web Token** (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519)
   - Official specification
   - Technical definition of JWT structure
   - Trust: Authoritative | Date: 2015 (stable spec)

3. **Auth0 Blog: JWT vs Sessions** (https://auth0.com/blog/jwt-vs-sessions/)
   - Comparison table
   - Real-world trade-offs
   - Security considerations
   - Trust: High (Auth0 is authority on auth) | Date: 2023

4. **Stack Overflow: JWT vs Session Cookies** (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43452896/)
   - Community discussion
   - Multiple perspectives
   - 450+ upvotes
   - Trust: Medium | Date: 2019 (check if still accurate)

**Key Takeaways**:

- JWT is stateless; session is stateful
- JWT better for distributed systems
- Sessions easier to revoke
- JWT requires careful security (HTTPS, secret management)
- Both have valid use cases

**Code Examples**:
(Will need to create example showing both approaches)

**Open Questions**:

- How do you handle JWT revocation? (Research in later question)
- What are specific security best practices? (Covered in security question)

**Confidence Level**: High (multiple authoritative sources agree)
```

#### Step 5: Document Code Examples

When you find code:

```markdown
**Code Example**: Basic JWT Generation (Node.js)

**Source**: JWT.io documentation

**Language**: JavaScript (Node.js)

**Dependencies**: jsonwebtoken package

**Code**:
\`\`\`javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

const token = jwt.sign(
{ userId: 123, email: 'user@example.com' },
'your-secret-key',
{ expiresIn: '1h' }
);

console.log(token);
// eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
\`\`\`

**Notes**:

- Never hardcode secrets in production
- Token expires in 1 hour (expiresIn)
- Payload should not contain sensitive data (it's base64 encoded, not encrypted)

**Testing Status**: Not yet tested (will test in code example creation phase)

**Attribution**: https://jwt.io/introduction
```

#### Step 6: Note Conflicting Information

When sources disagree:

```markdown
**Conflicting Information Noted**:

**Question**: Should JWTs be stored in localStorage or cookies?

**Position A** (Source: Auth0 Blog):

- Use httpOnly cookies for better XSS protection
- LocalStorage vulnerable to XSS attacks
- Cookies auto-sent by browser (secure if configured correctly)

**Position B** (Source: Some Medium articles):

- Use localStorage for easier mobile app integration
- Cookies subject to CSRF (require CSRF tokens)
- LocalStorage gives more control

**Resolution**:

- Security best practice: httpOnly cookies (prevents XSS access)
- Trade-off: Cookies require CSRF protection
- Context matters: SPA vs traditional web app
- Recommendation: httpOnly cookies + SameSite attribute + CSRF tokens

**Confidence**: Medium (context-dependent, both approaches have merit)
```

### 4. Track Research Progress

Maintain a progress tracker:

**Create status document:**

```markdown

## Purpose

This task enables automated execution of technical research queries using available tools in your environment. It systematically researches chapter topics, gathers technical information, evaluates sources, and compiles findings into a structured report. This automation saves time while ensuring comprehensive coverage and proper source attribution.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this task:

- Research queries generated (from create-book-research-queries.md or provided directly)
- At least one research tool available (WebSearch, Perplexity, or MCP tools)
- Chapter topic and target audience identified
- Understanding of desired research depth

## Available Research Tools

This task integrates with these tools when available:

**WebSearch** - General web search:

- Best for: Current information, documentation, tutorials
- Strengths: Broad coverage, recent content, diverse sources
- Use for: General queries, best practices, code examples

**Perplexity** - AI-powered research:

- Best for: Synthesized analysis, comparisons, explanations
- Strengths: Source aggregation, contextual understanding
- Use for: Complex concepts, technical comparisons, trends

**MCP Tools** - Model Context Protocol tools:

- Best for: Specialized research (academic papers, documentation APIs)
- Strengths: Domain-specific knowledge, structured data
- Use for: Academic research, API references, specifications

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Detect Available Research Tools

Identify which tools are accessible:

**Detection Logic:**

```
Check environment for:
- WebSearch capability (search API available)
- Perplexity access (API key or integration configured)
- MCP tools (context7, academic search, documentation fetchers)

Document available tools for user awareness
Provide fallback messaging if tools unavailable
```

**User Notification:**

```
Available research tools detected:
✓ WebSearch - Enabled
✓ Perplexity - Not available (no API key)
✓ MCP Tools - context7 (documentation lookup)

Research will proceed using WebSearch and context7.
```

### 2. Match Query Types to Optimal Tools

Select the best tool for each query type:

**Tool Selection Matrix:**

| Query Type      | Priority 1                 | Priority 2        | Priority 3 |
| --------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------- |
| Official docs   | context7 (docs API)        | WebSearch         | Perplexity |
| Code examples   | WebSearch                  | context7 (GitHub) | Perplexity |
| Best practices  | Perplexity                 | WebSearch         | MCP        |
| Technical specs | WebSearch (official sites) | context7          | Perplexity |
| Comparisons     | Perplexity                 | WebSearch         | MCP        |
| Academic        | MCP (academic tools)       | Perplexity        | WebSearch  |

**Selection Criteria:**

- Prioritize official sources for definitions and specifications
- Use AI tools (Perplexity) for synthesized explanations
- Use web search for practical examples and community insights
- Use MCP tools for specialized or structured data

**Fallback Strategy:**

- If preferred tool unavailable, use next priority
- If no tools available, output queries for manual research
- Inform user of tool selection rationale

### 3. Parse and Organize Research Queries

Structure queries for execution:

**Organization:**

1. Group queries by category (Technical Concepts, Code Examples, etc.)
2. Assign tool to each query based on type
3. Prioritize queries (high/medium/low)
4. Determine execution order (parallel where possible, sequential if dependent)

**Example:**

```
Query Group 1: Technical Concepts (Priority: High, Tool: WebSearch)
- Q1: What is the React Hooks API and why was it introduced?
- Q2: What are the rules of hooks and why do they exist?

Query Group 2: Code Examples (Priority: High, Tool: WebSearch + context7)
- Q3: Show me a simple example of useState and useEffect in React
- Q4: What are common patterns for using useEffect with cleanup?

Query Group 3: Expert Insights (Priority: Medium, Tool: Perplexity)
- Q5: What are performance considerations when using hooks?
- Q6: What are best practices for organizing hook logic?
```

### 4. Execute Queries Using Available Tools

Run queries systematically:

**Execution Pattern:**

```
For each query:
1. Select tool based on query type and availability
2. Format query for optimal tool performance
3. Execute query with appropriate parameters
4. Capture raw results
5. Log execution status (success/partial/failure)
6. Handle errors gracefully (retry, fallback, skip)
7. Apply rate limiting if needed
8. Update progress for user awareness
```

**Query Formatting by Tool:**

**WebSearch:**

```
Original: "What is the React Hooks API?"
Formatted: "React Hooks API documentation official"
```

**Perplexity:**

```
Original: "What are performance considerations for hooks?"
Formatted: "Explain performance implications and optimization strategies for React Hooks with examples"
```

**MCP/context7:**

```
Original: "Show me useState examples"
Formatted: "/reactjs/react docs:Hooks:useState examples"
```

**Error Handling:**

- Tool unavailable: Try fallback tool
- Rate limit hit: Queue query for later, continue with others
- No results: Log as gap, continue
- Tool error: Capture error, try alternative tool

### 5. Collect and Organize Findings by Query

Structure results for analysis:

**Finding Structure:**

```
Query: What is the React Hooks API and why was it introduced?

Finding:
  Answer: [Synthesized answer from sources]
  Sources:
    - URL: https://react.dev/reference/react
      Title: "React Hooks Documentation"
      Excerpt: "Hooks let you use state and other React features..."
      Date Accessed: 2025-10-25
      Credibility: Official Documentation
      Tool Used: WebSearch

    - URL: https://example.com/blog/hooks-intro
      Title: "Understanding React Hooks"
      Excerpt: "Hooks were introduced to solve problems with..."
      Date Accessed: 2025-10-25
      Credibility: Community Blog (Expert Author)
      Tool Used: WebSearch

  Synthesis: [Combined answer drawing from multiple sources]
  Confidence: High (multiple authoritative sources agree)
  Gaps: [Any unanswered aspects of the query]
```

**Organization:**

- Group findings by original research category
- Preserve source attribution for every fact
- Note which tool provided each finding
- Flag conflicting information across sources

### 6. Extract Source Citations and Credibility Metadata

Capture comprehensive source information:

**Citation Elements:**

- **URL**: Full web address
- **Title**: Page or article title
- **Author**: If identifiable
- **Publication Date**: If available
- **Access Date**: When research was conducted
- **Tool Used**: Which research tool found it
- **Content Type**: Documentation, blog, forum, academic, etc.

**Credibility Assessment:**

**Tier 1 - Authoritative:**

- Official documentation (React, MDN, W3C, etc.)
- Specifications and standards
- Core team statements
- Peer-reviewed academic papers

**Tier 2 - Expert:**

- Recognized expert blogs (Dan Abramov, Kent C. Dodds, etc.)
- Conference talks by core contributors
- Technical books by established authors
- High-quality tutorials from reputable sources

**Tier 3 - Community:**

- Stack Overflow answers (high votes)
- GitHub repositories with significant usage
- Community blogs and tutorials
- Forum discussions

**Tier 4 - Unverified:**

- Low-reputation sources
- Outdated content
- Unattributed information
- Conflicting with higher-tier sources

**Credibility Indicators:**

```
Source: https://react.dev/reference/react/useState
Title: "useState – React"
Credibility: Tier 1 (Official Documentation)
Indicators:
  ✓ react.dev domain (official)
  ✓ Maintained by React team
  ✓ Current version (updated 2024)
  ✓ Primary source
```

### 7. Synthesize Findings Across Multiple Sources

Combine information intelligently:

**Synthesis Process:**

1. Identify common themes across sources
2. Reconcile minor differences in explanation
3. Flag major conflicts or contradictions
4. Prefer authoritative sources for facts
5. Use community sources for practical insights
6. Combine complementary information
7. Note source agreement/disagreement

**Synthesis Example:**

```
Query: What are the rules of hooks?

Source 1 (Official Docs): "Only call hooks at the top level. Don't call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions."

Source 2 (Expert Blog): "Hooks must be called in the same order every render, which is why they can't be inside conditions."

Source 3 (Community Tutorial): "Always call hooks in the same order - that's why no conditional hooks."

Synthesized Answer:
React Hooks have a strict rule: they must be called at the top level of functional components or custom hooks, never inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. This requirement exists because React relies on hooks being called in the same order on every render to correctly track state between renders.

Sources: [1] Official React Documentation (react.dev), [2] "Understanding Hooks Rules" by Dan Abramov (blog), [3] "React Hooks Tutorial" (tutorial site)

Confidence: Very High (official source + expert confirmation + community consensus)
```

**Conflict Resolution:**

- **When sources conflict**: Present both views, note credibility tiers, indicate which is likely correct
- **When sources complement**: Combine information for comprehensive answer
- **When gaps exist**: Note what couldn't be answered, suggest manual follow-up

### 8. Identify Gaps or Conflicting Information

Document research limitations:

**Gap Types:**

**Information Gaps:**

- Questions with no satisfactory answers
- Queries that require domain expertise unavailable in sources
- Rapidly changing information (recent releases, breaking changes)
- Edge cases not documented

**Example:**

```
Gap Identified:
Query: What is the performance impact of many useState calls vs one useState with object?
Status: No authoritative answer found
Sources Consulted: Official docs (no mention), 2 blog posts (conflicting opinions), Stack Overflow (speculation)
Recommendation: Conduct manual benchmarking or consult React team directly
```

**Conflicting Information:**

- Sources that directly contradict each other
- Outdated information vs current information
- Theoretical vs practical differences

**Example:**

```
Conflict Identified:
Query: When does useEffect run?
Source A (Official Docs): "After the browser has painted"
Source B (Blog): "After render but before paint"
Resolution: Official documentation is authoritative. Source B may be outdated (pre-React 18).
Confidence: High (official source takes precedence)
```

**Outdated Content:**

- Information predating significant version changes
- Deprecated APIs or patterns
- Old best practices superseded by new approaches

**Documentation Strategy:**

- Clearly mark gaps for manual follow-up
- Present conflicting information with analysis
- Flag outdated content with version notes
- Suggest additional research paths

### 9. Auto-Populate book-research-report Template

Generate structured report:

**Template Population:**

1. Use book-research-report-tmpl.yaml structure
2. Populate all sections with research findings
3. Organize content by template sections
4. Preserve elicitation workflow for user review
5. Include all source citations
6. Add metadata (research method: "automated", tools used)

**Automated Sections:**

- **Research Context**: Derived from input parameters
- **Research Questions & Answers**: Populated from findings with citations
- **Technical Findings**: Synthesized from all sources
- **Code Examples Discovered**: Extracted code snippets with context
- **Expert Insights**: Quotes and insights from Tier 2 sources
- **Chapter Integration**: Preliminary outline suggestions
- **Additional Resources**: All sources in bibliographic format
- **Research Notes**: Gaps, conflicts, observations

**Elicitation Workflow:**

- Present auto-generated content to user
- Allow refinement of synthesized answers
- Enable adding manual insights
- Support removal of irrelevant findings
- Confirm chapter integration suggestions

**Output Example:**

```markdown
---
topic: Understanding React Hooks
date-created: 2025-10-25
research-method: automated
related-chapters: []
research-tools:
  - WebSearch
  - context7

## Examples

### Example 1: Automated Research for "Understanding React Hooks"

**Input:**

- Topic: Understanding React Hooks
- Audience: Intermediate React developers
- Queries: 15 questions across technical concepts, code examples, best practices

**Execution:**

1. **Tool Detection**: WebSearch available, context7 available
2. **Query Assignment**:
   - Concept queries → WebSearch (official React docs)
   - Code examples → WebSearch + context7 (GitHub examples)
   - Best practices → WebSearch (expert blogs)
3. **Execution**: 15 queries executed, 14 successful, 1 partial (rate limit)
4. **Findings**: 28 sources gathered (12 official docs, 10 expert blogs, 6 community)
5. **Synthesis**: Answers compiled from 2-4 sources each
6. **Gaps**: 1 query incomplete (performance benchmarking data), flagged for manual research
7. **Output**: Complete research report with 28 citations, ready for review

**Result:**

- Research time: 5 minutes (automated) vs ~2 hours (manual)
- Coverage: 93% complete (14/15 queries fully answered)
- Quality: High (multiple authoritative sources per query)
- User action: Review synthesis, fill 1 gap manually, approve report

### Example 2: Partial Automation (Limited Tools)

**Input:**

- Topic: Advanced TypeScript Patterns
- Audience: Experienced developers
- Queries: 20 questions on type theory, advanced patterns, performance

**Execution:**

1. **Tool Detection**: Only WebSearch available (no Perplexity, no MCP)
2. **Query Assignment**: All queries → WebSearch
3. **Execution**: 20 queries executed, 15 successful, 5 limited results
4. **Findings**: 35 sources (Official TypeScript docs, blogs, Stack Overflow)
5. **Gaps**: 5 queries need deeper analysis (would benefit from Perplexity)
6. **Output**: Research report with recommendation for manual deep-dive on 5 topics

**Result:**

- Research time: 8 minutes automated
- Coverage: 75% complete, 25% needs manual follow-up
- Quality: Good for covered areas, gaps clearly marked
- User action: Conduct manual research for 5 advanced topics, integrate results

## Integration with Workflows

This task integrates with:

- **create-book-research-queries.md**: Uses generated queries as input
- **book-research-report-tmpl.yaml**: Auto-populates template sections
- **technical-researcher agent**: Invoked via `*research-auto` command
- **chapter-development-workflow.yaml**: Feeds research into chapter writing

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Over-reliance on single tool**: Use multiple tools for validation
- **Ignoring source credibility**: Not all web results are equal
- **No synthesis**: Presenting raw results without combining/analyzing
- **Missing citations**: Every fact needs a source
- **Not handling failures**: Some queries will fail, handle gracefully
- **Assuming completeness**: Automated research may miss nuances
- **Skipping user review**: Always enable elicitation for refinement

## Next Steps

After automated research execution:

1. **Review findings**: Use elicitation workflow to validate synthesis
2. **Fill gaps**: Conduct manual research for incomplete queries
3. **Resolve conflicts**: Make decisions on conflicting information
4. **Refine examples**: Adapt code examples for your chapter context
5. **Integrate into chapter**: Use research to create chapter outline
6. **Save report**: Store in manuscripts/research/ for reference

- Save results to standard location
  output: reviews/checklist-results/{{checklist-name}}-{{timestamp}}.md

---

## Purpose

This task provides a structured way to execute quality checklists and document results. It ensures all checklist items are systematically evaluated with evidence, creating an auditable record of quality gate execution.

## Prerequisites

- Checklist file exists and is accessible
- Subject material to be reviewed is available
- Understanding of checklist criteria
- Authority to evaluate against checklist standards

## Inputs

**Required:**

- `checklist_path`: Path to the checklist markdown file (e.g., `checklists/code-quality-checklist.md`)
- `subject_name`: Descriptive name of what's being checked (e.g., "Chapter 3: Database Design", "User Authentication Module")

**Optional:**

- `context_notes`: Additional context for the review (e.g., "First draft", "Post-revision", "Version 2.0 update")

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Load Checklist File

Load and parse the checklist:

- Read the checklist file from `checklist_path`
- Identify all categories (markdown H2 headings)
- Extract all checklist items (lines starting with `- [ ]`)
- Count total items for summary statistics
- Verify checklist structure is valid

**Validation:**

- File exists and is readable
- Contains at least one category
- Contains at least one checklist item
- Items follow standard markdown checkbox format

### 2. Initialize Results Document

Create the results file structure:

- Generate timestamp for unique filename
- Extract checklist name from file path
- Create results file path: `reviews/checklist-results/{{checklist-name}}-{{timestamp}}.md`
- Initialize document with header information:
  - Subject name
  - Date and time
  - Checklist source path
  - Context notes (if provided)

**Note:** Results are saved incrementally as you progress through the checklist.

### 3. Process Each Category

Work through checklist categories systematically:

For each category (H2 section):

1. **Announce category**: State which category you're evaluating
2. **Read all items in category**: Get overview of what's being checked
3. **Process items sequentially**: Work through each checkbox item

**Process Flow:**

- Category 1 → All items → Results saved
- Category 2 → All items → Results saved
- Continue until all categories complete

### 4. Evaluate Each Checklist Item

For each checklist item, perform systematic evaluation:

**Evaluation Process:**

1. **Read the item**: Understand what's being checked
2. **Examine the subject**: Review relevant content/code/documentation
3. **Make determination**: Decide on status
4. **Document evidence**: Record specific findings

**Status Values:**

- **✅ PASS**: Item meets criteria fully
  - Provide brief evidence or write "Confirmed"
  - Example: "All code examples follow PEP 8 style guide"

- **❌ FAIL**: Item does not meet criteria
  - Document specific issue found
  - Explain why it fails
  - Provide recommendation for fix
  - Example: "Function `calculateTotal` missing error handling for empty cart scenario. Add validation before processing."

- **⊘ N/A**: Item not applicable to this subject
  - Explain why it doesn't apply
  - Example: "No JavaScript code in this chapter, checklist item not applicable"

**Evidence Requirements:**

- PASS: Brief confirmation or location reference
- FAIL: Detailed explanation with location and recommendation
- N/A: Reason for non-applicability

### 5. Handle Failed Items

When checklist item fails:

**Document Failure:**

- Mark status as ❌ FAIL
- Record specific location of issue (section, file, line number)
- Describe what was found vs what was expected
- Provide actionable recommendation for fixing

**Continue Execution:**

- Do NOT halt on failures (except critical issues - see below)
- Continue through all remaining items
- Capture complete picture of all issues

**Halt Immediately Only For:**

- Critical security vulnerabilities (exposed credentials, SQL injection)
- Data loss risks or corruption
- Legal/compliance violations
- Plagiarism or copyright infringement

If you encounter a halt-worthy issue:

1. Mark the item as ❌ FAIL with detailed explanation
2. Note "CRITICAL ISSUE - EXECUTION HALTED" in results
3. Stop checklist execution
4. Alert user immediately

### 6. Generate Summary Statistics

After all items processed (or if halted):

Calculate and include:

- **Total Items**: Count of all checklist items
- **Passed**: Count and percentage of PASS items
- **Failed**: Count and percentage of FAIL items
- **N/A**: Count and percentage of N/A items
- **Completion**: Percentage of applicable items that passed

**Overall Status Determination:**

- **PASS**: All applicable items passed (100% of PASS/(PASS+FAIL))
- **PASS WITH CONCERNS**: 80-99% pass rate, minor issues present
- **FAIL**: Less than 80% pass rate, significant issues present
- **CRITICAL FAILURE**: Execution halted due to critical issue

### 7. Create Failed Items Priority Section

If any items failed:

Create a dedicated section listing all failures:

**For Each Failed Item:**

- Category and item text
- Status: FAIL
- Evidence: Full details of what was found
- Location: Specific reference (section, file, line)
- Recommendation: How to fix the issue
- Priority: Based on severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)

**Purpose:** Provides quick reference for remediation work

### 8. Add Recommendations

Include actionable next steps:

**Recommendations based on overall status:**

- **PASS**: Subject meets all checklist criteria, ready to proceed
- **PASS WITH CONCERNS**: Address failed items before final approval
- **FAIL**: Must address all failures before proceeding
- **CRITICAL FAILURE**: Stop all work, address critical issue immediately

**Include:**

- Priority order for addressing failures
- Estimated effort for remediation
- Suggested next steps in workflow

### 9. Save Results

Save the complete results document:

- Write to `reviews/checklist-results/{{checklist-name}}-{{timestamp}}.md`
- Ensure directory exists (create if needed)
- Verify file was written successfully
- Provide user with results file path

**Results file includes:**

- Header with metadata

- Mark verification status (pending/verified/incorrect)

**Example Verification List:**

```
Statement: "React's useEffect runs after every render by default"
Location: Chapter 4, Section 2, Page 47
Source: https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect
Status: Pending verification
```

### 3. Verify Technical Statements Against Authoritative Sources

Check each statement for accuracy:

**Authoritative Sources (in priority order):**

1. **Official Documentation**
   - Language docs (Python.org, MDN, docs.oracle.com)
   - Framework official docs (reactjs.org, angular.io, vuejs.org)
   - Library documentation (official repos/sites)

2. **Standards and Specifications**
   - RFCs (IETF specifications)
   - PEPs (Python Enhancement Proposals)
   - ECMAScript specifications
   - W3C standards

3. **Official Release Notes**
   - Version-specific features
   - Deprecation notices
   - Breaking changes

4. **Reputable Technical Sources**
   - Official blogs (Mozilla Hacks, Go Blog, etc.)
   - Conference talks by maintainers
   - Authoritative technical books

**Verification Process:**

For each technical claim:

1. Locate authoritative source
2. Read relevant section carefully
3. Compare claim to source
4. Note any discrepancies
5. Check version applicability
6. Record verification result

**Document Findings:**

**For Correct Statements:**

```
Statement: "React's useEffect runs after every render by default"
Verification: CORRECT
Source: https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect
Notes: Confirmed in official docs. True when no dependency array provided.
```

**For Incorrect Statements:**

```
Statement: "Python's len() returns 1-indexed length"
Verification: INCORRECT
Severity: Critical
Correct Info: len() returns 0-indexed count (number of items)
Source: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#len
Example: len([10, 20, 30]) returns 3, not 4
```

**For Imprecise Statements:**

```
Statement: "useEffect runs after render"
Verification: IMPRECISE
Severity: Minor
Correct Info: "useEffect runs after render is committed to the screen (after browser paint)"
Source: https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect
Notes: Original statement is technically correct but lacks precision
```

### 4. Test All Code Examples for Correctness

Validate code execution and output:

**For Each Code Example:**

**Step 1: Extract Code**

- Copy complete code example
- Include all shown imports/dependencies
- Note any setup code mentioned

**Step 2: Set Up Test Environment**

- Install correct language/framework versions
- Install required dependencies
- Configure environment as specified

**Step 3: Run Code**

- Execute code exactly as shown
- Capture actual output
- Note any errors or warnings

**Step 4: Compare Results**

- Does output match claimed output?
- Does behavior match description?
- Are there any unexpected errors?

**Document Test Results:**

**Working Example:**

```
Location: Chapter 3, Example 3.2
Code: Array.map() example
Test Result: PASS
Output: Matches expected output exactly
Environment: Node.js 20.0.0
```

**Broken Example:**

```
Location: Chapter 5, Example 5.1
Code: Async database query
Test Result: FAIL
Severity: Critical
Error: TypeError: Cannot read property 'query' of undefined
Issue: Missing connection initialization code
Fix: Add `const connection = await createConnection()` before query
```

**Incomplete Example:**

```
Location: Chapter 7, Example 7.3
Code: Express middleware
Test Result: INCOMPLETE
Severity: Major
Issue: Missing import statements (express, body-parser)
Fix: Add required imports at top of example
```

### 5. Check API and Library Usage

Verify API calls are correct and current:

**For Each API/Library Call:**

**Check:**

- Function signature matches documentation
- Parameters in correct order
- Parameter types are correct
- Return type is accurate
- Method exists (not deprecated or renamed)
- Version compatibility

**Common API Issues:**

❌ **Incorrect Parameter Order:**

```javascript
// Content claims:
axios.get(headers, url);

// Actual correct usage:
axios.get(url, { headers });
```

❌ **Deprecated API:**

```javascript
// Content uses:
ReactDOM.render(<App />, container);

// Current API (React 18+):
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(container);
root.render(<App />);
```

❌ **Wrong Return Type:**

```python
# Content claims map() returns a list
result = map(lambda x: x * 2, [1, 2, 3])
# Actually returns an iterator in Python 3

# Correct statement:
result = list(map(lambda x: x * 2, [1, 2, 3]))
```

**Document API Issues:**

```
Location: Chapter 6, Section 3
API: Array.prototype.sort()
Severity: Major
Issue: Claims sort() returns a new array
Correct: sort() mutates the original array in-place and returns reference to it
Source: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort
Impact: Readers may misunderstand side effects
```

### 6. Validate Diagrams Match Descriptions

Ensure visual representations are accurate:

**For Each Diagram:**

**Check:**

- Does diagram accurately represent the concept?
- Do labels match terminology in text?
- Are connections/flows correct?
- Are there any misleading elements?
- Does diagram match code/examples?

**Common Diagram Issues:**

- Arrows pointing wrong direction in data flow
- Components labeled differently than in code
- Missing important elements mentioned in text
- Oversimplification that creates misconceptions

**Document Diagram Issues:**

```
Location: Chapter 4, Figure 4.2
Diagram: React component lifecycle
Severity: Major
Issue: Shows componentWillMount as recommended lifecycle method
Correct: componentWillMount is deprecated (React 16.3+); show componentDidMount instead
Source: https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#componentwillmount
```

### 7. Cross-Check Terminology Consistency

Verify consistent and correct terminology:

**Check:**

- Terms used consistently throughout
- Technical terms spelled correctly
- Acronyms expanded on first use
- No conflating of distinct concepts

**Common Terminology Issues:**

❌ **Inconsistent Terms:**

- Uses "function," "method," and "procedure" interchangeably when discussing JavaScript
- Correct: Distinguish class methods from standalone functions

❌ **Incorrect Technical Terms:**

- Calls all errors "exceptions" in JavaScript
- Correct: JavaScript has errors; some languages have exceptions with different semantics

❌ **Conflated Concepts:**

- Uses "authentication" and "authorization" as synonyms
- Correct: Authentication = who you are, Authorization = what you can do

**Document Terminology Issues:**

```
Location: Throughout Chapter 8
Severity: Minor
Issue: Inconsistent terminology - alternates between "async function" and "asynchronous function"
Recommendation: Choose one term and use consistently (prefer "async function" as it matches the keyword)
```

### 8. Identify Outdated or Deprecated Information

Flag content that needs updating:

**Check For:**

**Deprecated Language Features:**

- Python 2 syntax in Python 3+ content
- var keyword in modern JavaScript guides
- Old-style React class components without hooks mention

**Deprecated APIs:**

- Removed or deprecated functions/methods
- Outdated library APIs
- Framework features replaced by newer approaches

**Outdated Best Practices:**

- Callback-based patterns when async/await is standard
- Older architectural patterns superseded
- Security practices now considered inadequate

**End-of-Life Software:**

- Libraries no longer maintained
- Language versions past EOL
- Frameworks without active support

**Document Outdated Content:**

```
Location: Chapter 9, Section 4
Severity: Major
Issue: Demonstrates Promise chaining with .then()
Current Standard: async/await is now the standard (Node 8+, released 2017)
Recommendation: Show .then() chaining briefly for understanding, then demonstrate async/await as the recommended approach
Source: Modern JavaScript best practices (MDN)
```

```
Location: Chapter 3, Examples
Severity: Critical
Issue: All examples use React class components
Current Standard: Functional components with Hooks (React 16.8+, 2019)
Recommendation: Rewrite examples using functional components with useState, useEffect
Source: https://react.dev/learn - official docs now teach hooks-first
```

### 9. Run Technical Accuracy Checklist

Execute systematic checklist:

**Run:** `execute-checklist.md` with `technical-accuracy-checklist.md`

**Verify:**

- All technical claims verified
- Version numbers correct
- API usage current
- Language features accurate
- Framework concepts correct
- No outdated information
- Sources verified
- Code correctness confirmed
- Best practices current
- Misconceptions avoided

**Document** any checklist items that fail.

## Quality Standards

Effective accuracy verification:

✓ Verifies every technical claim against sources
✓ Tests all code examples in proper environment
✓ Checks API correctness against current docs
✓ Identifies all deprecated/outdated content
✓ Uses authoritative sources for verification
✓ Provides specific corrections with references
✓ Categorizes by appropriate severity
✓ Includes actionable recommendations

## Examples

### Example: Factual Error Found

**Finding:**

```
Location: Chapter 3, Section 2, Page 34
Statement: "JavaScript's Array.sort() always sorts alphabetically"
Verification: INCORRECT
Severity: Critical

Correct Information:
Array.sort() converts elements to strings and sorts in UTF-16 code unit order by default.
For numbers: [1, 10, 2].sort() returns [1, 10, 2] (NOT [1, 2, 10])
To sort numbers: array.sort((a, b) => a - b)

Source: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort

Impact: Readers will incorrectly sort numeric arrays, causing bugs

Recommended Fix:
"JavaScript's Array.sort() converts elements to strings and sorts in UTF-16 code unit order.
For numeric arrays, provide a compare function: numbers.sort((a, b) => a - b)"
```

### Example: Code Example Failure

**Finding:**

```
Location: Chapter 5, Example 5.3
Code Example: Async database query
Test Result: FAIL
Severity: Critical

Error:
```

TypeError: Cannot read property 'query' of undefined
at example5-3.js:10:25

````

Issue: Missing database connection initialization
The example calls db.query() but never shows db connection setup

Fixed Code:
```javascript
// Add before the query:
const db = await createConnection({
  host: 'localhost',
  user: 'root',
  password: 'password',
  database: 'testdb'
})

// Then the query works:
const results = await db.query('SELECT * FROM users')
````

Recommendation: Either add connection setup to example, or add a note:
"Assuming db connection is already established (see Chapter 4)"

```

### Example: Deprecated API Usage

**Finding:**

```

Location: Chapter 7, Throughout
API: ReactDOM.render()
Severity: Major

Issue: All examples use ReactDOM.render(<App />, root)
This API is deprecated in React 18 (March 2022)

Current API:

```javascript
// Old (deprecated):
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));

// Current (React 18+):
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);
```

Source: https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/08/react-18-upgrade-guide

Recommendation: Update all examples to use createRoot API, or add prominent warning that examples use React 17 API

```

## Next Steps

After verification:

1. Deliver verification report to author
2. Author addresses critical issues (must fix)
3. Author addresses major issues (should fix)
4. Re-verify code examples if critical fixes made
5. Approve for next review phase (editorial/QA)

      - Note source credibility (official docs, blog, forum, etc.)

      Example:
      ### Technical Concepts

      **Q: What is the React Hooks API and why was it introduced?**
      A: React Hooks were introduced in React 16.8 to allow functional components to use state and other React features without writing class components. They solve the problems of component logic reuse, complex component hierarchies, and confusing lifecycle methods.

      *Source: [React Hooks Documentation](https://react.dev/reference/react) (Official Docs) - Accessed 2025-10-25*

      **Q: What are the rules of hooks and why do they exist?**
      A: Hooks have two rules: (1) Only call hooks at the top level (not in loops, conditions, or nested functions), (2) Only call hooks from React function components or custom hooks. These rules ensure hooks are called in the same order on every render, which is how React tracks hook state between renders.

      *Source: [Rules of Hooks](https://react.dev/warnings/invalid-hook-call-warning) (Official Docs) - Accessed 2025-10-25*
    elicit: true

  - id: technical_findings
    title: Technical Findings
    instruction: |
      Synthesize key technical discoveries from your research:
      - Main concepts and how they work
      - Technical specifications or requirements
      - Important terminology and definitions
      - How different concepts relate to each other
      - Performance characteristics or limitations

      For each finding:
      - State the finding clearly
      - Provide supporting evidence from sources
      - Assess source credibility
      - Note any conflicting information found

      Distinguish between:
      - **Official/Authoritative**: Specs, official docs, core team statements
      - **Community/Practical**: Blogs, tutorials, Stack Overflow, GitHub discussions
      - **Academic/Research**: Papers, studies, formal analysis

      Example:
      ### Key Technical Findings

      1. **Hooks eliminate "wrapper hell"**: Multiple sources confirm that hooks reduce deeply nested component hierarchies caused by HOCs and render props. This is a primary design goal.
         - *Official: [Motivation for Hooks](https://react.dev/learn) - React Team*
         - *Community: [Practical Benefits of Hooks](https://example.com/blog) - Dan Abramov*

      2. **useState is synchronous within render, async for updates**: useState returns current state immediately, but state updates are batched and applied asynchronously. This is a common source of confusion.
         - *Official: [useState Reference](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState) - React Docs*
         - *Community: Multiple Stack Overflow discussions confirm this behavior*
    elicit: true

  - id: code_examples
    title: Code Examples Discovered
    instruction: |
      Document useful code examples found during research:
      - Paste or describe the code example
      - Explain what the code demonstrates
      - Note the source and credibility
      - Assess applicability to your chapter (direct use, needs adaptation, reference only)
      - Identify any issues or improvements needed

      Example:
      ### Code Examples

      #### Example 1: Basic useState Hook
      ```javascript
      import { useState } from 'react';

      function Counter() {
        const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

        return (
          <div>
            <p>Count: {count}</p>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
          </div>
        );
      }
      ```

      **Demonstrates**: Basic useState syntax, state initialization, state updates
      **Source**: [React Docs - useState](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState) (Official)
      **Applicability**: Direct use in introductory section
      **Notes**: Clean example, perfect for beginners

      #### Example 2: Custom Hook for Data Fetching
      ```javascript

  - id: expert_insights
    title: Expert Insights Captured
    instruction: |
      Document insights from expert sources:
      - Best practices and recommendations
      - Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
      - Performance considerations
      - Security implications
      - Industry perspectives
      - Quotes from recognized experts

      For each insight:

      - Cite the expert source
      - Explain relevance to your chapter

      Example:
      ### Expert Insights

      1. **Hooks simplify component logic organization**
         - *"With Hooks, you can extract stateful logic from a component so it can be tested independently and reused. Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy."* - React Team
         - **Source**: [Motivation for Hooks](https://react.dev/learn) (Official Docs)
         - **Relevance**: Key selling point to emphasize in introduction

      2. **Common mistake: Missing dependencies in useEffect**
         - *"If you forget to include dependencies in the dependency array, your effect will use stale values from previous renders. The React team recommends using the eslint-plugin-react-hooks to catch these bugs."* - Dan Abramov
         - **Source**: [A Complete Guide to useEffect](https://example.com/blog) (Expert Blog)
         - **Relevance**: Must include in "Common Pitfalls" section

      3. **Performance optimization with useMemo and useCallback**
         - *"Don't optimize prematurely. useMemo and useCallback should be used when you have measured performance problems, not preemptively for every function and calculation."* - Kent C. Dodds
         - **Source**: [When to useMemo and useCallback](https://example.com/blog) (Expert Blog)
         - **Relevance**: Include in advanced optimization section with this caveat

      ### Research Notes

      **Gaps Identified:**
      - Limited examples of hooks with TypeScript (need to research separately)
      - Few resources on testing custom hooks (found one good article, need more)

      **Conflicting Information:**
      - Some sources claim useEffect runs after every render, others say "after paint" - need to clarify timing precisely

      **Unanswered Questions:**
      - What is the performance impact of many useState calls vs one useState with object?
      - How do hooks work with React Server Components?

      **Ideas Generated:**
      - Create comparison table: class lifecycle methods vs hooks equivalents
      - Build a "hooks playground" interactive example for readers
      - Include debugging section with React DevTools

      **Surprising Discoveries:**
      - The eslint-plugin-react-hooks is more important than I thought - should be mandatory
      - Custom hooks don't have to start with "use" but convention is strong

# Learning Frameworks for Technical Writing

This document provides pedagogical frameworks essential for designing effective technical books and tutorials.

## Bloom's Taxonomy

Bloom's Taxonomy provides a hierarchy of cognitive skills from simple recall to complex creation. Use it to design learning progression and create appropriate learning objectives.

### The Six Levels

#### 1. Remember (Lowest Level)

**Description:** Recall facts, terms, basic concepts

**Action Verbs:**

- List, Define, Name, Identify, Label
- Describe, Recognize, Recall, State

**Example Learning Objectives:**

- "List the main HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)"
- "Identify the components of a REST API"
- "Define what JWT authentication means"

**Assessment:** Multiple choice, matching, simple recall questions

---

#### 2. Understand

**Description:** Explain ideas or concepts

**Action Verbs:**

- Explain, Describe, Summarize, Interpret
- Compare, Classify, Discuss, Paraphrase

**Example Learning Objectives:**

- "Explain how JWT tokens provide stateless authentication"
- "Describe the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code"
- "Summarize the benefits of using TypeScript over JavaScript"

**Assessment:** Short answer explanations, concept mapping

---

#### 3. Apply

**Description:** Use information in new situations

**Action Verbs:**

- Implement, Execute, Use, Apply
- Demonstrate, Build, Solve, Show

**Example Learning Objectives:**

- "Implement user authentication using Passport.js"
- "Build a REST API with CRUD operations"
- "Use async/await to handle asynchronous operations"

**Assessment:** Coding exercises, hands-on projects

---

#### 4. Analyze

**Description:** Draw connections, distinguish between parts

**Action Verbs:**

- Analyze, Compare, Contrast, Examine
- Debug, Troubleshoot, Differentiate, Investigate

**Example Learning Objectives:**

- "Analyze database query performance using EXPLAIN"
- "Debug memory leaks in Node.js applications"
- "Compare SQL vs NoSQL for specific use cases"

**Assessment:** Debugging tasks, performance analysis, case studies

---

#### 5. Evaluate

**Description:** Justify decisions, make judgments

**Action Verbs:**

- Evaluate, Assess, Critique, Judge
- Optimize, Recommend, Justify, Argue

**Example Learning Objectives:**

- Define terminology
- Explain core concepts
- Simple examples

**Middle Chapters (Apply + Analyze):**

- Hands-on implementation
- Debugging exercises
- Comparative analysis

**Late Chapters (Evaluate + Create):**

- Optimization challenges
- Design decisions
- Original projects

---

## Scaffolding Principles

Scaffolding provides temporary support structures that help learners achieve more than they could independently, then gradually removes support as competence grows.

### Core Principles

#### 1. Start with Concrete Examples

- Show working code first
- Use real-world scenarios
- Demonstrate before explaining theory
- Tangible results build confidence

**Example:**

```
❌ Poor: "RESTful APIs follow stateless client-server architecture..."
✅ Better: "Here's a working API endpoint. Let's see what happens when we call it, then understand why it works this way."
```

#### 2. Progress to Abstract Concepts

- After concrete understanding, introduce theory
- Connect examples to general principles
- Explain underlying concepts
- Build mental models

**Progression:**

1. Working example
2. What it does (concrete)
3. How it works (mechanism)
4. Why it works (theory)
5. When to use it (application)

#### 3. Build on Prior Knowledge

- Explicitly state prerequisites
- Reference previous chapters
- Activate existing knowledge
- Connect new to known

**Example:**

```
"In Chapter 3, we learned about promises. Async/await is syntactic sugar that makes promises easier to work with..."
```

#### 4. Gradual Complexity Increase

- Start simple, add features incrementally
- Introduce one new concept at a time
- Build up to complex examples
- Avoid overwhelming cognitive load

**Progressive Build:**

1. Basic function
2. Add error handling
3. Add logging
4. Add caching
5. Add advanced features

#### 5. Guided → Independent Practice

- Start with step-by-step tutorials
- Reduce guidance gradually
- End with independent challenges
- Build reader confidence

**Practice Progression:**

1. **Guided**: "Follow these steps exactly..."
2. **Partial guidance**: "Now implement X using the same pattern..."
3. **Independent**: "Build feature Y on your own..."
4. **Challenge**: "Design and implement Z..."

## Cognitive Load Management

Cognitive Load Theory explains how working memory limitations affect learning. Technical books must manage cognitive load carefully.

### Types of Cognitive Load

#### 1. Intrinsic Load

- Inherent difficulty of the material
- Cannot be reduced without changing content
- Manage by proper sequencing

**Strategy:** Break complex topics into smaller chunks

#### 2. Extraneous Load

- Unnecessary cognitive effort
- Caused by poor instruction design
- CAN and SHOULD be minimized

**Causes:**

- Confusing explanations
- Unclear code examples
- Missing context
- Poor organization

#### 3. Germane Load

- Effort required to build understanding
- Desirable difficulty
- Promotes schema construction

**Strategy:** Use exercises and practice that build understanding

### Cognitive Load Management Strategies

#### 1. Chunking Information

- Break content into digestible pieces
- Group related concepts together
- Use clear section headings
- Limit scope of each section

**Example:**

```
❌ Poor: One 40-page chapter on "Database Design"
✅ Better: Four 10-page chapters: "Schema Design", "Indexing", "Normalization", "Optimization"
```

#### 2. Progressive Disclosure

- Introduce information when needed
- Don't front-load everything
- Just-in-time teaching
- Hide complexity until required

**Example:**

```
Chapter 1: Basic SQL queries (SELECT, WHERE)
Chapter 2: Joins and relationships
Chapter 3: Advanced queries (subqueries, CTEs)
Chapter 4: Optimization and indexes
```

#### 3. Worked Examples Before Practice

- Show complete solutions first
- Explain step-by-step
- Then ask readers to practice
- Reduces cognitive load of problem-solving while learning

**Pattern:**

1. Show complete example with explanation
2. Show similar example with partial explanation
3. Ask reader to complete similar task
4. Provide independent challenge

#### 4. Dual Coding (Text + Visual)

- Use diagrams to complement text
- Code examples with visual flow diagrams
- Screenshots of results
- Reduces cognitive load by distributing across channels

**Effective Visuals:**

- Architecture diagrams
- Flow charts
- Sequence diagrams
- Database schemas
- API request/response flows

---

## Adult Learning Principles

Adult learners have specific characteristics that affect technical book design.

### Key Principles

- Career relevance
- Immediate applicability

**Application:**

- Start chapters with real-world problems
- Show industry use cases
- Explain job market demand
- Provide production-ready patterns

#### 3. Adults are Problem-Oriented

- Learn best through solving problems
- Prefer practical over theoretical
- Want working solutions
- Value hands-on practice

**Application:**

- Problem-based learning approach
- Tutorials over lectures
- Working code examples
- Real projects

#### 4. Adults Bring Experience

- Acknowledge existing knowledge
- Build on prior experience
- Allow knowledge transfer
- Respect diverse backgrounds

**Application:**
