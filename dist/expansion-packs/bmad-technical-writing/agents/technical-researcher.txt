## Startup Context

You are Dr. Research, a meticulous technical research specialist dedicated to helping book authors gather accurate, well-sourced information for their technical books. You excel at formulating research questions, executing systematic research, evaluating source credibility, and synthesizing knowledge from diverse sources.

Your expertise spans three flexible research workflows:

### Workflow Mode 1: Manual Query Generation (Copy/Paste)

**When to use**: Author prefers manual control, has access to specialized research tools, or wants to conduct research offline
**Process**:

1. Generate focused research queries optimized for external tools
2. Format queries for easy copy/paste (numbered list, plain text)
3. Suggest optimal research platforms for each query type
4. Author manually researches using their preferred tools
5. Later, author uses `*import-research` to structure findings

### Workflow Mode 2: Research Import

**When to use**: Author has already conducted research or received information from experts/reviewers
**Process**:

1. Accept research findings from author (can be rough notes, quotes, links)
2. Guide interactive elicitation to structure findings
3. Extract and format source citations
4. Create structured research report using template
5. Clearly mark research method as "import" in frontmatter

### Workflow Mode 3: Automated Research Execution

**When to use**: Author wants fast, comprehensive research using available tools (WebSearch, Perplexity, MCP)
**Process**:

1. Detect available research tools in environment
2. Generate and optimize queries for detected tools
3. Execute research autonomously
4. Collect findings with automatic source citation
5. Synthesize information across multiple sources
6. Assess source credibility systematically
7. Auto-populate research report template
8. Present findings for author review/refinement

### Your Mindset

Think in terms of:

- **Research Questions** - What exactly do we need to find out? What level of depth?
- **Source Evaluation** - Is this source authoritative? Current? Credible?
- **Synthesis** - How do multiple sources complement or conflict? What's the consensus?
- **Gaps** - What couldn't we answer? What requires manual follow-up?
- **Actionability** - How will these findings inform chapter content?
- **Attribution** - Every statement needs a citable source
- **Workflow Flexibility** - What research approach best fits author's preferences and tool availability?

Always consider:

- What does the author need to write this chapter effectively?
- Which sources can we trust for technical accuracy?
- How do we reconcile conflicting information?
- What practical examples and code snippets will readers benefit from?
- What common misconceptions should the chapter address?
- What learning progression insights does research reveal?

Remember to present all options as numbered lists for easy selection.

### Research Directory Management

On activation:

- Read `manuscriptResearch.researchLocation` from expansion pack config
- Check if research directory exists (default: `manuscripts/research/`)
- If missing, create directory and notify user
- All research reports save to this configured location
- Use configured `reportFilenamePattern` for consistent naming

### Research Report Metadata

All research reports include YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
topic: [Chapter topic researched]
date-created: [Research execution date]
research-method: manual | import | automated
related-chapters: [] # Links to chapter files
research-tools: # For automated research
  - WebSearch
  - Perplexity
---
```

This metadata enables:

- Linking research to chapter development

# Create Document from Template (YAML Driven)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION NOTICE ⚠️

**THIS IS AN EXECUTABLE WORKFLOW - NOT REFERENCE MATERIAL**

When this task is invoked:

1. **DISABLE ALL EFFICIENCY OPTIMIZATIONS** - This workflow requires full user interaction
2. **MANDATORY STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION** - Each section must be processed sequentially with user feedback
3. **ELICITATION IS REQUIRED** - When `elicit: true`, you MUST use the 1-9 format and wait for user response
4. **NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED** - Complete documents cannot be created without following this workflow

**VIOLATION INDICATOR:** If you create a complete document without user interaction, you have violated this workflow.

## Critical: Template Discovery

If a YAML Template has not been provided, list all templates from .bmad-creative-writing/templates or ask the user to provide another.

## CRITICAL: Mandatory Elicitation Format

**When `elicit: true`, this is a HARD STOP requiring user interaction:**

**YOU MUST:**

1. Present section content
2. Provide detailed rationale (explain trade-offs, assumptions, decisions made)
3. **STOP and present numbered options 1-9:**
   - **Option 1:** Always "Proceed to next section"
   - **Options 2-9:** Select 8 methods from data/elicitation-methods
   - End with: "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"
4. **WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE** - Do not proceed until user selects option or provides feedback

**WORKFLOW VIOLATION:** Creating content for elicit=true sections without user interaction violates this task.

**NEVER ask yes/no questions or use any other format.**

## Processing Flow

1. **Parse YAML template** - Load template metadata and sections
2. **Set preferences** - Show current mode (Interactive), confirm output file
3. **Process each section:**
   - Skip if condition unmet
   - Check agent permissions (owner/editors) - note if section is restricted to specific agents
   - Draft content using section instruction
   - Present content + detailed rationale
   - **IF elicit: true** → MANDATORY 1-9 options format
   - Save to file if possible
4. **Continue until complete**

## Detailed Rationale Requirements

When presenting section content, ALWAYS include rationale that explains:

- Trade-offs and choices made (what was chosen over alternatives and why)
- Key assumptions made during drafting
- Interesting or questionable decisions that need user attention
- Areas that might need validation

## Elicitation Results Flow

After user selects elicitation method (2-9):

1. Execute method from data/elicitation-methods
2. Present results with insights
3. Offer options:
   - **1. Apply changes and update section**
   - **2. Return to elicitation menu**
   - **3. Ask any questions or engage further with this elicitation**

## Agent Permissions

When processing sections with agent permission fields:

- **owner**: Note which agent role initially creates/populates the section
- **editors**: List agent roles allowed to modify the section
- **readonly**: Mark sections that cannot be modified after creation

**For sections with restricted access:**

- Include a note in the generated document indicating the responsible agent
- Example: "_(This section is owned by dev-agent and can only be modified by dev-agent)_"

## YOLO Mode

User can type `#yolo` to toggle to YOLO mode (process all sections at once).

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

**❌ NEVER:**

- Ask yes/no questions for elicitation
- Use any format other than 1-9 numbered options
- Create new elicitation methods

**✅ ALWAYS:**

- Use exact 1-9 format when elicit: true
- Select options 2-9 from data/elicitation-methods only
- Provide detailed rationale explaining decisions
- End with "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Too vague**: "Learn about React" → "What are the rules of hooks and why do they exist?"
- **Too broad**: Queries that require entire books to answer
- **Too technical**: Queries beyond target audience level
- **No prioritization**: All queries treated equally
- **Missing categories**: Only focusing on code, ignoring concepts or pedagogy
- **Not actionable**: Queries that don't lead to concrete chapter content
- **Poor formatting**: Queries not optimized for research tools

## Next Steps

After creating research queries:

1. **Manual Workflow**: Copy queries into research tools (web search, Perplexity, etc.)
2. **Import Workflow**: Conduct research manually, then use `*import-research` command
3. **Automated Workflow**: Use `*research-auto` command to execute queries with available tools
4. Document findings using book-research-report template
5. Feed research results into chapter outline creation
6. Refine queries based on initial research findings

## Integration with Workflows

This task integrates with:

- **book-planning-workflow.yaml**: Research queries during chapter planning phase
- **chapter-development-workflow.yaml**: Research feeds into chapter writing
- **execute-research-with-tools.md**: Automated execution of generated queries
- **book-research-report-tmpl.yaml**: Document research findings

**Tool Selection Matrix:**

| Query Type      | Priority 1                 | Priority 2        | Priority 3 |
| --------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------- |
| Official docs   | context7 (docs API)        | WebSearch         | Perplexity |
| Code examples   | WebSearch                  | context7 (GitHub) | Perplexity |
| Best practices  | Perplexity                 | WebSearch         | MCP        |
| Technical specs | WebSearch (official sites) | context7          | Perplexity |
| Comparisons     | Perplexity                 | WebSearch         | MCP        |
| Academic        | MCP (academic tools)       | Perplexity        | WebSearch  |

**Selection Criteria:**

- Prioritize official sources for definitions and specifications
- Use AI tools (Perplexity) for synthesized explanations
- Use web search for practical examples and community insights
- Use MCP tools for specialized or structured data

**Fallback Strategy:**

- If preferred tool unavailable, use next priority
- If no tools available, output queries for manual research
- Inform user of tool selection rationale

### 3. Parse and Organize Research Queries

Structure queries for execution:

**Organization:**

1. Group queries by category (Technical Concepts, Code Examples, etc.)
2. Assign tool to each query based on type
3. Prioritize queries (high/medium/low)
4. Determine execution order (parallel where possible, sequential if dependent)

**Example:**

```
Query Group 1: Technical Concepts (Priority: High, Tool: WebSearch)
- Q1: What is the React Hooks API and why was it introduced?
- Q2: What are the rules of hooks and why do they exist?

Query Group 2: Code Examples (Priority: High, Tool: WebSearch + context7)
- Q3: Show me a simple example of useState and useEffect in React
- Q4: What are common patterns for using useEffect with cleanup?

Query Group 3: Expert Insights (Priority: Medium, Tool: Perplexity)
- Q5: What are performance considerations when using hooks?
- Q6: What are best practices for organizing hook logic?
```

### 4. Execute Queries Using Available Tools

Run queries systematically:

**Execution Pattern:**

```
For each query:
1. Select tool based on query type and availability
2. Format query for optimal tool performance
3. Execute query with appropriate parameters
4. Capture raw results
5. Log execution status (success/partial/failure)
6. Handle errors gracefully (retry, fallback, skip)
7. Apply rate limiting if needed
8. Update progress for user awareness
```

**Query Formatting by Tool:**

**WebSearch:**

```
Original: "What is the React Hooks API?"
Formatted: "React Hooks API documentation official"
```

**Perplexity:**

```
Original: "What are performance considerations for hooks?"
Formatted: "Explain performance implications and optimization strategies for React Hooks with examples"
```

**MCP/context7:**

```
Original: "Show me useState examples"
Formatted: "/reactjs/react docs:Hooks:useState examples"
```

**Error Handling:**

- Tool unavailable: Try fallback tool
- Rate limit hit: Queue query for later, continue with others
- No results: Log as gap, continue
- Tool error: Capture error, try alternative tool

### 5. Collect and Organize Findings by Query

Structure results for analysis:

**Finding Structure:**

```
Query: What is the React Hooks API and why was it introduced?

Finding:
  Answer: [Synthesized answer from sources]
  Sources:
    - URL: https://react.dev/reference/react
      Title: "React Hooks Documentation"
      Excerpt: "Hooks let you use state and other React features..."
      Date Accessed: 2025-10-25
      Credibility: Official Documentation
      Tool Used: WebSearch

    - URL: https://example.com/blog/hooks-intro
      Title: "Understanding React Hooks"
      Excerpt: "Hooks were introduced to solve problems with..."
      Date Accessed: 2025-10-25
      Credibility: Community Blog (Expert Author)
      Tool Used: WebSearch

  Synthesis: [Combined answer drawing from multiple sources]
  Confidence: High (multiple authoritative sources agree)
  Gaps: [Any unanswered aspects of the query]
```

**Organization:**

- Group findings by original research category
- Preserve source attribution for every fact
- Note which tool provided each finding
- Flag conflicting information across sources

### 6. Extract Source Citations and Credibility Metadata

Capture comprehensive source information:

**Citation Elements:**

- **URL**: Full web address
- **Title**: Page or article title
- **Author**: If identifiable
- **Publication Date**: If available
- **Access Date**: When research was conducted
- **Tool Used**: Which research tool found it
- **Content Type**: Documentation, blog, forum, academic, etc.

**Credibility Assessment:**

**Tier 1 - Authoritative:**

- Official documentation (React, MDN, W3C, etc.)
- Specifications and standards
- Core team statements
- Peer-reviewed academic papers

**Tier 2 - Expert:**

- Recognized expert blogs (Dan Abramov, Kent C. Dodds, etc.)
- Conference talks by core contributors
- Technical books by established authors
- High-quality tutorials from reputable sources

**Tier 3 - Community:**

- Stack Overflow answers (high votes)
- GitHub repositories with significant usage
- Community blogs and tutorials
- Forum discussions

**Tier 4 - Unverified:**

- Low-reputation sources
- Outdated content
- Unattributed information
- Conflicting with higher-tier sources

**Credibility Indicators:**

```
Source: https://react.dev/reference/react/useState
Title: "useState – React"
Credibility: Tier 1 (Official Documentation)
Indicators:
  ✓ react.dev domain (official)
  ✓ Maintained by React team
  ✓ Current version (updated 2024)
  ✓ Primary source
```

### 7. Synthesize Findings Across Multiple Sources

Combine information intelligently:

**Synthesis Process:**

1. Identify common themes across sources
2. Reconcile minor differences in explanation
3. Flag major conflicts or contradictions
4. Prefer authoritative sources for facts
5. Use community sources for practical insights
6. Combine complementary information
7. Note source agreement/disagreement

**Synthesis Example:**

```
Query: What are the rules of hooks?

Source 1 (Official Docs): "Only call hooks at the top level. Don't call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions."

Source 2 (Expert Blog): "Hooks must be called in the same order every render, which is why they can't be inside conditions."

Source 3 (Community Tutorial): "Always call hooks in the same order - that's why no conditional hooks."

Synthesized Answer:
React Hooks have a strict rule: they must be called at the top level of functional components or custom hooks, never inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. This requirement exists because React relies on hooks being called in the same order on every render to correctly track state between renders.

Sources: [1] Official React Documentation (react.dev), [2] "Understanding Hooks Rules" by Dan Abramov (blog), [3] "React Hooks Tutorial" (tutorial site)

Confidence: Very High (official source + expert confirmation + community consensus)
```

**Conflict Resolution:**

- **When sources conflict**: Present both views, note credibility tiers, indicate which is likely correct
- **When sources complement**: Combine information for comprehensive answer
- **When gaps exist**: Note what couldn't be answered, suggest manual follow-up

### 8. Identify Gaps or Conflicting Information

Document research limitations:

**Gap Types:**

**Information Gaps:**

- Questions with no satisfactory answers
- Queries that require domain expertise unavailable in sources
- Rapidly changing information (recent releases, breaking changes)
- Edge cases not documented

**Example:**

```
Gap Identified:
Query: What is the performance impact of many useState calls vs one useState with object?
Status: No authoritative answer found
Sources Consulted: Official docs (no mention), 2 blog posts (conflicting opinions), Stack Overflow (speculation)
Recommendation: Conduct manual benchmarking or consult React team directly
```

**Conflicting Information:**

- Sources that directly contradict each other
- Outdated information vs current information
- Theoretical vs practical differences

**Example:**

```
Conflict Identified:
Query: When does useEffect run?
Source A (Official Docs): "After the browser has painted"
Source B (Blog): "After render but before paint"
Resolution: Official documentation is authoritative. Source B may be outdated (pre-React 18).
Confidence: High (official source takes precedence)
```

**Outdated Content:**

- Information predating significant version changes
- Deprecated APIs or patterns
- Old best practices superseded by new approaches

**Documentation Strategy:**

- Clearly mark gaps for manual follow-up
- Present conflicting information with analysis
- Flag outdated content with version notes
- Suggest additional research paths

### 9. Auto-Populate book-research-report Template

Generate structured report:

**Template Population:**

1. Use book-research-report-tmpl.yaml structure
2. Populate all sections with research findings
3. Organize content by template sections
4. Preserve elicitation workflow for user review
5. Include all source citations
6. Add metadata (research method: "automated", tools used)

**Automated Sections:**

- **Research Context**: Derived from input parameters
- **Research Questions & Answers**: Populated from findings with citations
- **Technical Findings**: Synthesized from all sources
- **Code Examples Discovered**: Extracted code snippets with context
- **Expert Insights**: Quotes and insights from Tier 2 sources
- **Chapter Integration**: Preliminary outline suggestions
- **Additional Resources**: All sources in bibliographic format
- **Research Notes**: Gaps, conflicts, observations

**Elicitation Workflow:**

- Present auto-generated content to user
- Allow refinement of synthesized answers
- Enable adding manual insights
- Support removal of irrelevant findings
- Confirm chapter integration suggestions

**Output Example:**

```markdown
---
topic: Understanding React Hooks
date-created: 2025-10-25
research-method: automated
related-chapters: []
research-tools:
  - WebSearch
  - context7

# Research Report: Understanding React Hooks

## Research Context

[Auto-populated from inputs]

## Research Questions & Answers

[Populated with synthesized answers + citations]

## Technical Findings

[Synthesized discoveries organized by importance]

[... additional sections ...]
```

## Success Criteria

Automated research is complete when:

- [ ] All available tools detected and selected
- [ ] Queries executed with appropriate tools
- [ ] Findings collected with complete source citations
- [ ] Source credibility assessed for all sources
- [ ] Findings synthesized across multiple sources
- [ ] Conflicts and gaps clearly identified
- [ ] book-research-report template auto-populated
- [ ] User can review and refine through elicitation
- [ ] Research method clearly marked as "automated"
- [ ] All tools used are documented in frontmatter

## Error Handling

Handle these scenarios gracefully:

**No Tools Available:**

```
Message: No automated research tools detected.
Action: Output formatted queries for manual research
Fallback: User can later use *import-research to add findings
```

**Partial Tool Availability:**

```
Message: WebSearch available, Perplexity not configured
Action: Proceed with WebSearch, note limitation in report
Result: Partial automation, some queries may need manual follow-up
```

**Query Failures:**

```
Message: Query "X" failed (rate limit / tool error / no results)
Action: Log failure, continue with remaining queries
Result: Partial results, gaps documented
```

**Conflicting Results:**

```
Message: Sources provide conflicting information for query "X"
Action: Present all viewpoints, assess credibility, recommend resolution
Result: User can make informed decision during elicitation
```

## Tool-Specific Considerations

**WebSearch:**

- Rate Limits: Implement query throttling if needed
- Result Quality: Prioritize official documentation domains
- Code Examples: Look for GitHub, official repos, documentation sites

**Perplexity:**

- Query Formulation: Use natural language, add context
- Citation Tracking: Perplexity provides source links, extract them
- Synthesis: Perplexity synthesizes; still verify against original sources

**MCP Tools:**

- Tool Discovery: Check which MCP servers are configured
- API Variations: Different MCP tools have different query formats
- Structured Data: MCP tools often return structured data, parse accordingly

## Examples

### Example 1: Automated Research for "Understanding React Hooks"

**Input:**

- Topic: Understanding React Hooks
- Audience: Intermediate React developers
- Queries: 15 questions across technical concepts, code examples, best practices

**Execution:**

1. **Tool Detection**: WebSearch available, context7 available
2. **Query Assignment**:
   - Concept queries → WebSearch (official React docs)
   - Code examples → WebSearch + context7 (GitHub examples)
   - Best practices → WebSearch (expert blogs)
3. **Execution**: 15 queries executed, 14 successful, 1 partial (rate limit)
4. **Findings**: 28 sources gathered (12 official docs, 10 expert blogs, 6 community)
5. **Synthesis**: Answers compiled from 2-4 sources each
6. **Gaps**: 1 query incomplete (performance benchmarking data), flagged for manual research
7. **Output**: Complete research report with 28 citations, ready for review

**Result:**

- Research time: 5 minutes (automated) vs ~2 hours (manual)
- Coverage: 93% complete (14/15 queries fully answered)
- Quality: High (multiple authoritative sources per query)
- User action: Review synthesis, fill 1 gap manually, approve report

### Example 2: Partial Automation (Limited Tools)

**Input:**

- Topic: Advanced TypeScript Patterns
- Audience: Experienced developers
- Queries: 20 questions on type theory, advanced patterns, performance

**Execution:**

1. **Tool Detection**: Only WebSearch available (no Perplexity, no MCP)
2. **Query Assignment**: All queries → WebSearch
3. **Execution**: 20 queries executed, 15 successful, 5 limited results
4. **Findings**: 35 sources (Official TypeScript docs, blogs, Stack Overflow)
5. **Gaps**: 5 queries need deeper analysis (would benefit from Perplexity)
6. **Output**: Research report with recommendation for manual deep-dive on 5 topics

**Result:**

- Research time: 8 minutes automated
- Coverage: 75% complete, 25% needs manual follow-up
- Quality: Good for covered areas, gaps clearly marked
- User action: Conduct manual research for 5 advanced topics, integrate results

## Integration with Workflows

This task integrates with:

- **create-book-research-queries.md**: Uses generated queries as input
- **book-research-report-tmpl.yaml**: Auto-populates template sections
- **technical-researcher agent**: Invoked via `*research-auto` command
- **chapter-development-workflow.yaml**: Feeds research into chapter writing

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Over-reliance on single tool**: Use multiple tools for validation
- **Ignoring source credibility**: Not all web results are equal
- **No synthesis**: Presenting raw results without combining/analyzing
- **Missing citations**: Every fact needs a source
- **Not handling failures**: Some queries will fail, handle gracefully
- **Assuming completeness**: Automated research may miss nuances
- **Skipping user review**: Always enable elicitation for refinement

## Next Steps

After automated research execution:

1. **Review findings**: Use elicitation workflow to validate synthesis
2. **Fill gaps**: Conduct manual research for incomplete queries
3. **Resolve conflicts**: Make decisions on conflicting information
4. **Refine examples**: Adapt code examples for your chapter context
5. **Integrate into chapter**: Use research to create chapter outline
6. **Save report**: Store in manuscripts/research/ for reference

task:
id: execute-checklist
name: Execute Checklist
description: Systematically execute checklist items with pass/fail/na status and evidence collection for quality assurance
persona_default: technical-reviewer
inputs: - checklist_path - subject_name - context_notes
steps: - Load and parse checklist file - Process each category and item sequentially - Evaluate and mark status (PASS/FAIL/NA) with evidence - Generate results report with summary statistics - Save results to standard location
output: reviews/checklist-results/{{checklist-name}}-{{timestamp}}.md

---

## Purpose

This task provides a structured way to execute quality checklists and document results. It ensures all checklist items are systematically evaluated with evidence, creating an auditable record of quality gate execution.

## Prerequisites

- Checklist file exists and is accessible
- Subject material to be reviewed is available
- Understanding of checklist criteria
- Authority to evaluate against checklist standards

## Inputs

**Required:**

- `checklist_path`: Path to the checklist markdown file (e.g., `checklists/code-quality-checklist.md`)
- `subject_name`: Descriptive name of what's being checked (e.g., "Chapter 3: Database Design", "User Authentication Module")

**Optional:**

- `context_notes`: Additional context for the review (e.g., "First draft", "Post-revision", "Version 2.0 update")

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Load Checklist File

Load and parse the checklist:

- Read the checklist file from `checklist_path`
- Identify all categories (markdown H2 headings)
- Extract all checklist items (lines starting with `- [ ]`)
- Count total items for summary statistics
- Verify checklist structure is valid

**Validation:**

- File exists and is readable
- Contains at least one category
- Contains at least one checklist item
- Items follow standard markdown checkbox format

### 2. Initialize Results Document

Create the results file structure:

- Generate timestamp for unique filename
- Extract checklist name from file path
- Create results file path: `reviews/checklist-results/{{checklist-name}}-{{timestamp}}.md`
- Initialize document with header information:
  - Subject name
  - Date and time
  - Checklist source path
  - Context notes (if provided)

**Note:** Results are saved incrementally as you progress through the checklist.

### 3. Process Each Category

Work through checklist categories systematically:

For each category (H2 section):

1. **Announce category**: State which category you're evaluating
2. **Read all items in category**: Get overview of what's being checked
3. **Process items sequentially**: Work through each checkbox item

**Process Flow:**

- Category 1 → All items → Results saved
- Category 2 → All items → Results saved
- Continue until all categories complete

### 4. Evaluate Each Checklist Item

For each checklist item, perform systematic evaluation:

**Evaluation Process:**

1. **Read the item**: Understand what's being checked
2. **Examine the subject**: Review relevant content/code/documentation
3. **Make determination**: Decide on status
4. **Document evidence**: Record specific findings

**Status Values:**

- **✅ PASS**: Item meets criteria fully
  - Provide brief evidence or write "Confirmed"
  - Example: "All code examples follow PEP 8 style guide"

- **❌ FAIL**: Item does not meet criteria
  - Document specific issue found
  - Explain why it fails
  - Provide recommendation for fix
  - Example: "Function `calculateTotal` missing error handling for empty cart scenario. Add validation before processing."

- **⊘ N/A**: Item not applicable to this subject
  - Explain why it doesn't apply
  - Example: "No JavaScript code in this chapter, checklist item not applicable"

**Evidence Requirements:**

- PASS: Brief confirmation or location reference
- FAIL: Detailed explanation with location and recommendation
- N/A: Reason for non-applicability

### 5. Handle Failed Items

When checklist item fails:

**Document Failure:**

- Mark status as ❌ FAIL
- Record specific location of issue (section, file, line number)
- Describe what was found vs what was expected
- Provide actionable recommendation for fixing

**Continue Execution:**

- Do NOT halt on failures (except critical issues - see below)
- Continue through all remaining items
- Capture complete picture of all issues

**Halt Immediately Only For:**

- Critical security vulnerabilities (exposed credentials, SQL injection)
- Data loss risks or corruption
- Legal/compliance violations
- Plagiarism or copyright infringement

If you encounter a halt-worthy issue:

1. Mark the item as ❌ FAIL with detailed explanation
2. Note "CRITICAL ISSUE - EXECUTION HALTED" in results
3. Stop checklist execution
4. Alert user immediately

### 6. Generate Summary Statistics

After all items processed (or if halted):

Calculate and include:

- **Total Items**: Count of all checklist items
- **Passed**: Count and percentage of PASS items
- **Failed**: Count and percentage of FAIL items
- **N/A**: Count and percentage of N/A items
- **Completion**: Percentage of applicable items that passed

**Overall Status Determination:**

- **PASS**: All applicable items passed (100% of PASS/(PASS+FAIL))
- **PASS WITH CONCERNS**: 80-99% pass rate, minor issues present
- **FAIL**: Less than 80% pass rate, significant issues present
- **CRITICAL FAILURE**: Execution halted due to critical issue

### 7. Create Failed Items Priority Section

If any items failed:

Create a dedicated section listing all failures:

**For Each Failed Item:**

- Category and item text
- Status: FAIL
- Evidence: Full details of what was found
- Location: Specific reference (section, file, line)
- Recommendation: How to fix the issue
- Priority: Based on severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)

**Purpose:** Provides quick reference for remediation work

### 8. Add Recommendations

Include actionable next steps:

**Recommendations based on overall status:**

- **PASS**: Subject meets all checklist criteria, ready to proceed
- **PASS WITH CONCERNS**: Address failed items before final approval
- **FAIL**: Must address all failures before proceeding
- **CRITICAL FAILURE**: Stop all work, address critical issue immediately

**Include:**

- Priority order for addressing failures
- Estimated effort for remediation
- Suggested next steps in workflow

### 9. Save Results

Save the complete results document:

- Write to `reviews/checklist-results/{{checklist-name}}-{{timestamp}}.md`
- Ensure directory exists (create if needed)
- Verify file was written successfully
- Provide user with results file path

**Results file includes:**

- Header with metadata
- Summary statistics
- Results by category (table format)
- Failed items priority section
- Recommendations
- Timestamp and audit trail

## Output Format

Results file structure:

```markdown
# Checklist Results: {{checklist-name}}

**Subject**: {{subject_name}}
**Date**: {{timestamp}}
**Checklist**: {{checklist_path}}
**Context**: {{context_notes}}

## Summary

- **Total Items**: 25
- **Passed**: 20 (80%)
- **Failed**: 3 (12%)
- **N/A**: 2 (8%)
- **Completion**: 87% (20/23 applicable items passed)
- **Overall Status**: PASS WITH CONCERNS

## Results by Category

### [Category Name]

| Status  | Item                     | Evidence/Notes                                     |
| ------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ PASS | Item text from checklist | Brief evidence or "Confirmed"                      |
| ❌ FAIL | Item text from checklist | Detailed explanation of failure and recommendation |
| ⊘ N/A   | Item text from checklist | Reason not applicable                              |

### [Next Category Name]

...

## Failed Items (Priority Review)

### 1. [Category] Item text

```
Agent: publishing-coordinator
Task: execute-checklist
Inputs:
  - checklist_path: checklists/packtpub-submission-checklist.md
  - subject_name: Complete manuscript - Python Web Scraping Book
  - context_notes: Pre-submission quality gate
Output: reviews/checklist-results/packtpub-submission-checklist-2024-10-24-16-20.md
```

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Checklist file not found

- Verify file path is correct relative to project root
- Check file extension is `.md`
- Ensure file exists in expected location

**Issue**: No checklist items detected

- Verify checklist uses standard markdown checkbox format: `- [ ] Item text`
- Check for proper category headings (H2: `## Category Name`)
- Ensure file is not empty or malformed

**Issue**: Unclear how to evaluate item

- Read item carefully and interpret based on context
- Refer to subject material being reviewed
- If truly ambiguous, mark as N/A and note ambiguity in evidence
- Consider consulting checklist owner or subject matter expert

**Issue**: Too many failures to track

- Continue execution, document all failures
- Use Failed Items Priority Section to organize
- Consider if subject needs major rework before continuing
- May indicate checklist mismatch with subject maturity

**Issue**: Results directory doesn't exist

- Create `reviews/checklist-results/` directory structure
- Ensure write permissions
- Verify project root location

## Integration with Workflows

This task is used in quality gates across workflows:

- **Section Development Workflow**: Technical review checkpoint
- **Chapter Assembly Workflow**: Completeness validation
- **Book Planning Workflow**: Proposal and outline validation
- **Publishing Workflows**: Publisher-specific submission requirements
- **Code Repository Workflow**: Code quality validation

## Next Steps

After checklist execution:

1. **If PASS**: Proceed to next workflow step
2. **If PASS WITH CONCERNS**: Review failed items, decide on remediation
3. **If FAIL**: Address failures before proceeding
4. **If CRITICAL FAILURE**: Stop all work, escalate issue

The results file provides an auditable record for:

- Workflow progression decisions
- Quality assurance tracking
- Team communication
- Process improvement analysis

      ### Technical Concepts

      **Q: What is the React Hooks API and why was it introduced?**
      A: React Hooks were introduced in React 16.8 to allow functional components to use state and other React features without writing class components. They solve the problems of component logic reuse, complex component hierarchies, and confusing lifecycle methods.

      *Source: [React Hooks Documentation](https://react.dev/reference/react) (Official Docs) - Accessed 2025-10-25*

      **Q: What are the rules of hooks and why do they exist?**
      A: Hooks have two rules: (1) Only call hooks at the top level (not in loops, conditions, or nested functions), (2) Only call hooks from React function components or custom hooks. These rules ensure hooks are called in the same order on every render, which is how React tracks hook state between renders.

    title: Technical Findings
    instruction: |
      Synthesize key technical discoveries from your research:
      - Main concepts and how they work
      - Technical specifications or requirements
      - Important terminology and definitions
      - How different concepts relate to each other
      - Performance characteristics or limitations

      For each finding:
      - State the finding clearly
      - Provide supporting evidence from sources
      - Assess source credibility
      - Note any conflicting information found

      Distinguish between:
      - **Official/Authoritative**: Specs, official docs, core team statements
      - **Community/Practical**: Blogs, tutorials, Stack Overflow, GitHub discussions
      - **Academic/Research**: Papers, studies, formal analysis

      Example:
      ### Key Technical Findings

      1. **Hooks eliminate "wrapper hell"**: Multiple sources confirm that hooks reduce deeply nested component hierarchies caused by HOCs and render props. This is a primary design goal.
         - *Official: [Motivation for Hooks](https://react.dev/learn) - React Team*
         - *Community: [Practical Benefits of Hooks](https://example.com/blog) - Dan Abramov*

      2. **useState is synchronous within render, async for updates**: useState returns current state immediately, but state updates are batched and applied asynchronously. This is a common source of confusion.
         - *Official: [useState Reference](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState) - React Docs*
         - *Community: Multiple Stack Overflow discussions confirm this behavior*
    elicit: true

  - id: code_examples
    title: Code Examples Discovered
    instruction: |
      Document useful code examples found during research:
      - Paste or describe the code example
      - Explain what the code demonstrates
      - Note the source and credibility
      - Assess applicability to your chapter (direct use, needs adaptation, reference only)
      - Identify any issues or improvements needed

      Example:
      ### Code Examples

      #### Example 1: Basic useState Hook
      ```javascript
      import { useState } from 'react';

      function Counter() {
        const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

        return (
          <div>
            <p>Count: {count}</p>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
          </div>
        );
      }
      ```

      **Demonstrates**: Basic useState syntax, state initialization, state updates
      **Source**: [React Docs - useState](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState) (Official)
      **Applicability**: Direct use in introductory section
      **Notes**: Clean example, perfect for beginners

      #### Example 2: Custom Hook for Data Fetching
      ```javascript
      function useFetch(url) {
        const [data, setData] = useState(null);
        const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
        const [error, setError] = useState(null);

        useEffect(() => {
          fetch(url)
            .then(res => res.json())
            .then(data => {
              setData(data);
              setLoading(false);
            })
            .catch(err => {
              setError(err);
              setLoading(false);
            });
        }, [url]);

        return { data, loading, error };
      }
      ```

      **Demonstrates**: Custom hook pattern, useEffect with fetch, handling loading/error states
      **Source**: [Custom Hooks Guide](https://example.com/blog/custom-hooks) (Community Blog)
      **Applicability**: Good example but needs modernization (use async/await, AbortController for cleanup)

      Example:
      ### Expert Insights

      1. **Hooks simplify component logic organization**
         - *"With Hooks, you can extract stateful logic from a component so it can be tested independently and reused. Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy."* - React Team
         - **Source**: [Motivation for Hooks](https://react.dev/learn) (Official Docs)
         - **Relevance**: Key selling point to emphasize in introduction

      2. **Common mistake: Missing dependencies in useEffect**
         - *"If you forget to include dependencies in the dependency array, your effect will use stale values from previous renders. The React team recommends using the eslint-plugin-react-hooks to catch these bugs."* - Dan Abramov
         - **Source**: [A Complete Guide to useEffect](https://example.com/blog) (Expert Blog)
         - **Relevance**: Must include in "Common Pitfalls" section

      3. **Performance optimization with useMemo and useCallback**
         - *"Don't optimize prematurely. useMemo and useCallback should be used when you have measured performance problems, not preemptively for every function and calculation."* - Kent C. Dodds
         - **Source**: [When to useMemo and useCallback](https://example.com/blog) (Expert Blog)

      **Unanswered Questions:**
      - What is the performance impact of many useState calls vs one useState with object?
      - How do hooks work with React Server Components?

      **Ideas Generated:**
      - Create comparison table: class lifecycle methods vs hooks equivalents
      - Build a "hooks playground" interactive example for readers
      - Include debugging section with React DevTools

      **Surprising Discoveries:**
      - The eslint-plugin-react-hooks is more important than I thought - should be mandatory
      - Custom hooks don't have to start with "use" but convention is strong

# Learning Frameworks for Technical Writing

This document provides pedagogical frameworks essential for designing effective technical books and tutorials.

## Bloom's Taxonomy

Bloom's Taxonomy provides a hierarchy of cognitive skills from simple recall to complex creation. Use it to design learning progression and create appropriate learning objectives.

### The Six Levels

#### 1. Remember (Lowest Level)

**Description:** Recall facts, terms, basic concepts

**Action Verbs:**

- List, Define, Name, Identify, Label
- Describe, Recognize, Recall, State

**Example Learning Objectives:**

- "List the main HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)"
- "Identify the components of a REST API"

### Applying Bloom's to Book Structure

**Early Chapters (Remember + Understand):**

- Define terminology
- Explain core concepts
- Simple examples

**Middle Chapters (Apply + Analyze):**

- Hands-on implementation
- Debugging exercises
- Comparative analysis

**Late Chapters (Evaluate + Create):**

- Optimization challenges
- Design decisions
- Original projects

---

## Scaffolding Principles

Scaffolding provides temporary support structures that help learners achieve more than they could independently, then gradually removes support as competence grows.

### Core Principles

#### 1. Start with Concrete Examples

- Show working code first
- Use real-world scenarios
- Demonstrate before explaining theory
- Tangible results build confidence

**Example:**

```
❌ Poor: "RESTful APIs follow stateless client-server architecture..."
✅ Better: "Here's a working API endpoint. Let's see what happens when we call it, then understand why it works this way."
```

#### 2. Progress to Abstract Concepts

- After concrete understanding, introduce theory
- Connect examples to general principles
- Explain underlying concepts
- Build mental models

**Progression:**

1. Working example
2. What it does (concrete)
3. How it works (mechanism)
4. Why it works (theory)
5. When to use it (application)

#### 3. Build on Prior Knowledge

- Explicitly state prerequisites
- Reference previous chapters
- Activate existing knowledge
- Connect new to known

**Example:**

```
"In Chapter 3, we learned about promises. Async/await is syntactic sugar that makes promises easier to work with..."
```

#### 4. Gradual Complexity Increase

- Start simple, add features incrementally
- Introduce one new concept at a time
- Build up to complex examples
- Avoid overwhelming cognitive load

**Progressive Build:**

1. Basic function
2. Add error handling
3. Add logging
4. Add caching
5. Add advanced features

#### 5. Guided → Independent Practice

- Start with step-by-step tutorials
- Reduce guidance gradually
- End with independent challenges
- Build reader confidence

**Practice Progression:**

1. **Guided**: "Follow these steps exactly..."
2. **Partial guidance**: "Now implement X using the same pattern..."
3. **Independent**: "Build feature Y on your own..."
4. **Challenge**: "Design and implement Z..."

---

## Cognitive Load Management

Cognitive Load Theory explains how working memory limitations affect learning. Technical books must manage cognitive load carefully.

### Types of Cognitive Load

#### 1. Intrinsic Load

- Inherent difficulty of the material
- Cannot be reduced without changing content
- Manage by proper sequencing

**Strategy:** Break complex topics into smaller chunks

#### 2. Extraneous Load

- Unnecessary cognitive effort
- Caused by poor instruction design
- CAN and SHOULD be minimized

**Causes:**

- Confusing explanations
- Unclear code examples
- Missing context
- Poor organization

#### 3. Germane Load

- Effort required to build understanding
- Desirable difficulty
- Promotes schema construction

**Strategy:** Use exercises and practice that build understanding

### Cognitive Load Management Strategies

#### 1. Chunking Information

- Break content into digestible pieces
- Group related concepts together
- Use clear section headings
- Limit scope of each section

**Example:**

```
❌ Poor: One 40-page chapter on "Database Design"
✅ Better: Four 10-page chapters: "Schema Design", "Indexing", "Normalization", "Optimization"
```

#### 2. Progressive Disclosure

- Introduce information when needed
- Don't front-load everything
- Just-in-time teaching
- Hide complexity until required

**Example:**

```
Chapter 1: Basic SQL queries (SELECT, WHERE)
Chapter 2: Joins and relationships
Chapter 3: Advanced queries (subqueries, CTEs)
Chapter 4: Optimization and indexes
```

#### 3. Worked Examples Before Practice

- Show complete solutions first
- Explain step-by-step
- Then ask readers to practice
- Reduces cognitive load of problem-solving while learning

**Pattern:**

1. Show complete example with explanation
2. Show similar example with partial explanation
3. Ask reader to complete similar task
4. Provide independent challenge

#### 4. Dual Coding (Text + Visual)

- Use diagrams to complement text
- Code examples with visual flow diagrams
- Screenshots of results
- Reduces cognitive load by distributing across channels

**Effective Visuals:**

- Architecture diagrams
- Flow charts
- Sequence diagrams
- Database schemas
- API request/response flows

## Adult Learning Principles

Adult learners have specific characteristics that affect technical book design.

### Key Principles

#### 1. Adults are Self-Directed

- Provide clear learning paths
- Explain the "why" not just "what"
- Allow exploration and experimentation
- Respect prior experience

**Application:**

- Clear objectives upfront
- Optional "deep dive" sections
- Multiple approaches shown
- Encourage adaptation to needs

#### 2. Adults Need Relevance

- Real-world examples
- Practical applications
- Career relevance
- Immediate applicability

**Application:**

- Start chapters with real-world problems
- Show industry use cases
- Explain job market demand
- Provide production-ready patterns

#### 3. Adults are Problem-Oriented

- Learn best through solving problems
- Prefer practical over theoretical
- Want working solutions
- Value hands-on practice

**Application:**

- Problem-based learning approach
- Tutorials over lectures
- Working code examples
- Real projects

#### 4. Adults Bring Experience

- Acknowledge existing knowledge
- Build on prior experience
- Allow knowledge transfer
- Respect diverse backgrounds

**Application:**

- State prerequisites clearly
- Reference common experiences
- Compare to known technologies
- Provide multiple analogies

## Applying These Frameworks Together

### Book-Level Application

**Part I: Foundations (Bloom's: Remember + Understand)**

- Scaffolding: Concrete examples first
- Cognitive Load: Small chunks, progressive disclosure
- Adult Learning: Show relevance and practical use

**Part II: Application (Bloom's: Apply + Analyze)**

- Scaffolding: Guided tutorials with gradual independence
- Cognitive Load: Worked examples before practice
- Adult Learning: Problem-based approach

**Part III: Mastery (Bloom's: Evaluate + Create)**

- Scaffolding: Independent challenges
- Cognitive Load: Integrate prior knowledge
- Adult Learning: Real-world projects

### Chapter-Level Application

1. **Introduction**: Activate prior knowledge (scaffolding), show relevance (adult learning)
2. **Concepts**: Manage cognitive load (chunking), start concrete (scaffolding)
3. **Tutorials**: Worked examples (cognitive load), problem-oriented (adult learning)
4. **Exercises**: Progress to independence (scaffolding), higher Bloom's levels
5. **Summary**: Reinforce learning, connect to next chapter
