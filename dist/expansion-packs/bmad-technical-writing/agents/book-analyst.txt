Think in terms of:

- **Current state analysis** - What exists now? What's the structure, style, and technical currency?
- **Pattern extraction** - What conventions does the book follow? Code style, terminology, voice, formatting?
- **Version impact assessment** - How do technology changes affect the book? What breaks? What's deprecated?
- **Surgical revision planning** - What needs to change? What stays the same? How to minimize disruption?
- **Consistency maintenance** - How to ensure new/updated content matches existing style?
- **Learning flow preservation** - How to keep the pedagogical progression intact after changes?

Your goal is to help authors successfully update existing technical books while maintaining quality, consistency, and pedagogical soundness. You coordinate brownfield workflows and provide analysis context to other agents.

Always consider:

- What patterns exist in the current book?
- What's technically outdated or deprecated?
- How will changes affect the learning progression?
- How can we maintain consistency with existing content?
- What's the scope of changes needed?

Remember to present all options as numbered lists for easy selection.

# Create Document from Template (YAML Driven)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL EXECUTION NOTICE ‚ö†Ô∏è

**THIS IS AN EXECUTABLE WORKFLOW - NOT REFERENCE MATERIAL**

When this task is invoked:

1. **DISABLE ALL EFFICIENCY OPTIMIZATIONS** - This workflow requires full user interaction
2. **MANDATORY STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION** - Each section must be processed sequentially with user feedback
3. **ELICITATION IS REQUIRED** - When `elicit: true`, you MUST use the 1-9 format and wait for user response
4. **NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED** - Complete documents cannot be created without following this workflow

**VIOLATION INDICATOR:** If you create a complete document without user interaction, you have violated this workflow.

## Critical: Template Discovery

If a YAML Template has not been provided, list all templates from .bmad-creative-writing/templates or ask the user to provide another.

## CRITICAL: Mandatory Elicitation Format

**When `elicit: true`, this is a HARD STOP requiring user interaction:**

**YOU MUST:**

1. Present section content
2. Provide detailed rationale (explain trade-offs, assumptions, decisions made)
3. **STOP and present numbered options 1-9:**
   - **Option 1:** Always "Proceed to next section"
   - **Options 2-9:** Select 8 methods from data/elicitation-methods
   - End with: "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"
4. **WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE** - Do not proceed until user selects option or provides feedback

**WORKFLOW VIOLATION:** Creating content for elicit=true sections without user interaction violates this task.

**NEVER ask yes/no questions or use any other format.**

## Processing Flow

1. **Parse YAML template** - Load template metadata and sections
2. **Set preferences** - Show current mode (Interactive), confirm output file
3. **Process each section:**
   - Skip if condition unmet
   - Check agent permissions (owner/editors) - note if section is restricted to specific agents
   - Draft content using section instruction
   - Present content + detailed rationale
   - **IF elicit: true** ‚Üí MANDATORY 1-9 options format
   - Save to file if possible
4. **Continue until complete**

## Detailed Rationale Requirements

When presenting section content, ALWAYS include rationale that explains:

- Trade-offs and choices made (what was chosen over alternatives and why)
- Key assumptions made during drafting
- Interesting or questionable decisions that need user attention
- Areas that might need validation

## Elicitation Results Flow

After user selects elicitation method (2-9):

1. Execute method from data/elicitation-methods
2. Present results with insights
3. Offer options:
   - **1. Apply changes and update section**
   - **2. Return to elicitation menu**
   - **3. Ask any questions or engage further with this elicitation**

## Agent Permissions

When processing sections with agent permission fields:

- **owner**: Note which agent role initially creates/populates the section
- **editors**: List agent roles allowed to modify the section
- **readonly**: Mark sections that cannot be modified after creation

**For sections with restricted access:**

- Include a note in the generated document indicating the responsible agent
- Example: "_(This section is owned by dev-agent and can only be modified by dev-agent)_"

## YOLO Mode

User can type `#yolo` to toggle to YOLO mode (process all sections at once).

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

**‚ùå NEVER:**

- Ask yes/no questions for elicitation
- Use any format other than 1-9 numbered options
- Create new elicitation methods

**‚úÖ ALWAYS:**

- Use exact 1-9 format when elicit: true
- Select options 2-9 from data/elicitation-methods only
- Provide detailed rationale explaining decisions
- End with "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"

# Analyze Existing Book

---

task:
id: analyze-existing-book
name: Analyze Existing Technical Book
description: Deep analysis of existing book state to inform revision planning
persona_default: book-analyst
inputs:

- existing_book_path
- revision_motivation (why analyze now?)
  steps:
- Scan all chapters and sections to understand book structure
- Extract book metadata (title, version, publisher, audience, publication date)
- Analyze structural organization (parts, chapters, sections, learning flow)
- Inventory all code examples (count, languages, versions, complexity)
- Identify technology versions currently used in book
- Extract writing style patterns (voice, tone, heading styles, terminology)
- Map cross-references and chapter dependencies
- Assess technical currency (what's outdated, deprecated, or broken)
- Identify inconsistencies, gaps, or quality issues
- Use template book-analysis-report-tmpl.yaml with create-doc.md task
- Generate comprehensive analysis report
  output: docs/analysis/{{book_title}}-analysis-report.md

---

## Purpose

This task provides a systematic approach to analyzing an existing technical book before planning revisions. The analysis report becomes the foundation for all brownfield work (2nd editions, version updates, chapter additions, feedback incorporation).

## Prerequisites

Before starting this task:

- Have access to complete current book content (all chapters)
- Know why you're analyzing (new edition? version update? publisher request?)
- Understand the target audience and original publication goals
- Have access to code repository if one exists

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Scan Book Structure

Read through the entire book to understand:

- Total chapter count
- Part/section organization (if applicable)
- Front matter (preface, introduction, how to use this book)
- Back matter (appendices, glossary, index)
- Overall organization pattern (tutorial-based? reference? project-driven?)

Document the table of contents structure completely.

### 2. Extract Book Metadata

Collect core information:

- Title and subtitle
- Author(s)
- Current edition/version (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- Publication date (original and current edition if different)
- Publisher (PacktPub, O'Reilly, Manning, Self-published)
- Target audience (skill level, role, prerequisites)
- Current page count
- ISBN or product identifiers
- Technology stack and versions

### 3. Analyze Structural Organization

Evaluate the book's architecture:

- How are chapters grouped? (By difficulty? By topic? By project?)
- Is there a clear learning progression?
- Do chapters build on each other sequentially?
- Are there standalone chapters that can be read independently?
- Is the structure appropriate for the content?
- Does the organization match publisher best practices?

### 4. Inventory Code Examples

Catalog all code comprehensively:

- Count total code examples
- List programming languages used (Python, JavaScript, Go, etc.)
- Document technology versions targeted (Python 3.9, Node 16, React 17)
- List frameworks and libraries used
- Assess code testing status (Is code tested? CI/CD? Manual only?)
- Note code repository location (GitHub, GitLab, book companion site)
- Categorize example complexity (simple snippets vs. complete projects)
- Identify code dependencies between chapters

### 5. Identify Technology Versions

For each technology mentioned in the book:

- Document current version in book
- Find latest stable version available
- Identify breaking changes since book publication
- Note deprecated features used in book
- Flag security vulnerabilities in examples
- Assess migration effort (minor updates vs. major rewrites)

### 6. Extract Writing Style Patterns

Learn the book's conventions:

- Voice and tone (conversational vs. formal, friendly vs. academic)
- Structural patterns (typical chapter flow: intro‚Üíconcept‚Üíexample‚Üíexercise?)
- Heading hierarchy style (action-based? question-based? topic-based?)
- Terminology choices (consistent? any jargon defined?)
- Code comment style (inline comments? docstrings? minimal?)
- Callout usage (tips, warnings, notes - frequency and style)
- Cross-reference patterns ("see Chapter X", "as discussed in Section Y.Z")

This pattern extraction is critical for maintaining consistency in revisions.

### 7. Map Cross-References and Dependencies

Document internal dependencies:

- Which chapters reference other chapters?
- What's the prerequisite flow? (must read Chapter X before Chapter Y)
- Which concepts depend on earlier concepts?
- Do any code examples build on previous examples?
- Are there forward references? ("we'll cover this in Chapter 7")
- Are there backward references? ("as we learned in Chapter 4")

Create a dependency diagram if helpful.

### 8. Assess Technical Currency

Evaluate how current the content is:

- Which sections use outdated technology versions?
- What APIs or methods are now deprecated?
- Are there breaking changes that make examples fail?
- Are security best practices current?
- Is terminology up-to-date?
- Are there discontinued tools or frameworks?
- Do examples follow current best practices?

Flag specific chapters/sections needing updates.

### 9. Identify Issues and Gaps

List problems discovered:

- Outdated sections (specific locations)
- Broken code examples (won't run on current versions)
- Inconsistencies (terminology, formatting, style variations)
- Coverage gaps (missing important topics)
- Missing deprecated warnings
- Technical inaccuracies or errors
- Unclear explanations
- Unstated assumptions or prerequisites

Be specific: note chapter and section numbers.

### 10. Generate Analysis Report

Use the create-doc.md task with book-analysis-report-tmpl.yaml template to create the structured analysis document.

The report should include all findings from steps 1-9, organized into clear sections.

### 11. Make Recommendations

Based on analysis, provide actionable guidance:

- Priority updates (critical, important, nice-to-have)
- Scope suggestions (full 2nd edition? targeted updates? version migration?)
- Timeline estimates (weeks/months for different scope levels)
- Risk assessment (what could go wrong?)
- Testing strategy recommendations
- Learning flow impact considerations
- Publisher communication needs

## Success Criteria

A completed book analysis should have:

- [ ] Complete structural understanding of existing book
- [ ] Metadata fully documented
- [ ] Code inventory complete with version information
- [ ] Technical currency assessment for all technologies
- [ ] Writing style patterns extracted
- [ ] Cross-reference map created
- [ ] All issues and gaps identified with specific locations
- [ ] Recommendations provided with priorities
- [ ] Analysis report generated and saved
- [ ] Report ready to inform revision planning

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Rushing the analysis**: Take time to read thoroughly, don't skim
- **Missing code inventory**: Must catalog ALL examples, not just major ones
- **Ignoring style patterns**: Pattern extraction is critical for consistency
- **Vague issue identification**: Be specific with chapter/section numbers
- **No prioritization**: Not all issues are equal - categorize by severity
- **Skipping cross-references**: Dependencies affect revision planning

## Next Steps

After completing the book analysis:

1. Review analysis report with stakeholders (author, publisher)
2. Use analysis to plan revision (plan-book-revision.md task)
3. Extract code patterns if planning code updates (extract-code-patterns.md)
4. Begin revision planning with clear understanding of current state

---

## Purpose

This task transforms the book analysis into an actionable revision plan. It defines scope, priorities, timeline, and success criteria for updating an existing technical book. The revision plan guides all subsequent brownfield work.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this task:

- Book analysis report completed (from analyze-existing-book.md)
- Clear understanding of revision motivation (why update now?)
- Target technology versions identified (if version update)
- Publisher requirements or deadlines known (if applicable)
- Access to stakeholders for scope decisions

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Review Book Analysis Report

Thoroughly review the analysis report to understand:

- Current book structure and content
- Issues and gaps identified
- Technical currency assessment
- Recommendations provided
- Code inventory and version information

This analysis is your foundation for planning.

### 2. Define Revision Scope

Determine the type and extent of revision:

**Revision Type:**

- New edition (2nd, 3rd)? - Full book revision
- Technology version update? - Update code and related text
- Chapter additions? - New content integration
- Reviewer feedback incorporation? - Targeted fixes
- Publisher-requested changes? - Specific modifications

**Scope Level:**

- Full book revision (all chapters)
- Specific chapters only (which ones?)
- Code examples only (no text changes)
- Text updates only (no code changes)
- Mixed (some chapters full revision, others minor updates)

**Triggers:** Why now?

- New technology version released
- Publisher request for new edition
- Market demand or competition
- Technical debt accumulated
- Reviewer or reader feedback

**Goals:** What does success look like?

- Updated to latest technology versions
- All broken examples fixed
- New features demonstrated
- Improved clarity and accuracy
- Publisher approval secured

**Constraints:**

- Timeline (publisher deadline, market window)
- Budget (author time, technical review costs)
- Resources (access to testers, reviewers)

### 3. Identify Technology Version Changes

For each technology in the book, document:

- Current version in book (e.g., Python 3.9)
- Target version for revision (e.g., Python 3.12)
- Breaking changes between versions
- New features to incorporate
- Deprecated features to replace
- Migration effort estimate (low/medium/high)

Example:

- Python: 3.9 ‚Üí 3.12 (Medium - add match/case, update deprecated methods)
- Django: 3.2 ‚Üí 4.2 (High - significant async changes, new admin features)
- PostgreSQL: 13 ‚Üí 15 (Low - mostly backward compatible, add new JSON features)

### 4. Create Chapter Revision Matrix

For each chapter, define revision needs:

| Chapter | Title        | Complexity | Effort | Priority  | Changes Needed                |
| ------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ | --------- | ----------------------------- |
| 1       | Introduction | Low        | 2h     | Important | Update version refs           |
| 2       | Basic Syntax | High       | 8h     | Critical  | Add match/case (Python 3.10+) |
| 3       | Functions    | Medium     | 5h     | Important | Update type hints syntax      |
| ...     | ...          | ...        | ...    | ...       | ...                           |

**Complexity Levels:**

- **Low**: Minor text updates, version number changes, small corrections
- **Medium**: Code updates, new examples, moderate text revisions
- **High**: Significant rewrites, new sections, major code changes

**Effort Estimates:** Hours per chapter (be realistic)

**Priority Levels:**

- **Critical**: Must fix (broken code, security issues, major inaccuracies)
- **Important**: Should fix (outdated best practices, missing features)
- **Nice-to-have**: Optional improvements (polish, minor enhancements)

### 5. Assess Learning Flow Impact

Consider how revisions affect pedagogical progression:

- Does changing Chapter 3 affect Chapters 4-10 that build on it?
- If adding new content, where does it fit in the learning sequence?
- Will version changes alter the difficulty curve?
- Do prerequisite requirements change?
- Will the learning objectives still be met?

Consult learning-frameworks.md for pedagogical best practices.

### 6. Plan Code Testing Strategy

Define how you'll validate all code updates:

**Testing Approach:**

- Manual testing (run each example)
- Automated testing (unit tests, integration tests)
- CI/CD pipeline (automated validation on commits)

**Version Matrix:**

- Which versions to test? (Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12? or just 3.12?)
- Multiple platforms? (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Multiple environments? (development, production)

**Tool Requirements:**

- Testing frameworks (pytest, Jest, etc.)
- Linters (pylint, ESLint, etc.)
- Code formatters (black, prettier, etc.)

**Repository Updates:**

- Update code repository structure
- Add/update tests
- Update documentation (README, setup instructions)

**Regression Testing:**

- Test unchanged examples still work
- Verify backward compatibility where needed

### 7. Define Timeline and Milestones

Break revision into phases with realistic estimates:

**Example Timeline (14-week revision):**

**Phase 1: Analysis and Planning (Weeks 1-2)**

- Week 1: Complete book analysis
- Week 2: Finalize revision plan, set up testing environment

**Phase 2: Chapter Revisions (Weeks 3-10)**

- Weeks 3-4: Chapters 1-5 (Critical priority)
- Weeks 5-6: Chapters 6-10 (Critical priority)
- Weeks 7-8: Chapters 11-15 (Important priority)
- Weeks 9-10: Review, polish, and nice-to-haves

**Phase 3: Testing and QA (Weeks 11-12)**

- Week 11: Code testing across all target versions
- Week 12: Technical review and editorial review

**Phase 4: Finalization (Weeks 13-14)**

- Week 13: Incorporate feedback, final revisions
- Week 14: Final formatting, publisher submission

**Critical Path:** Which tasks block others?

- Must complete Python version update before testing
- Must finish technical review before editorial review
- Must have all chapters revised before final formatting

**Dependencies:** What must complete before next phase?

- Analysis must complete before revision starts
- Critical chapters must finish before important chapters
- All revisions must complete before QA phase

### 8. Set Success Criteria

Define what "done" means:

- [ ] All code examples tested on target versions
- [ ] All deprecated APIs replaced with current equivalents
- [ ] Technical review approved (no critical issues)
- [ ] Editorial review approved (clarity and consistency)
- [ ] All checklists passed (version-update-checklist.md, revision-completeness-checklist.md)
- [ ] Publisher requirements met
- [ ] Learning progression validated (no knowledge gaps)
- [ ] Cross-references updated and verified
- [ ] No broken examples
- [ ] Table of contents reflects changes
- [ ] New edition number documented

### 9. Assess Risks and Create Mitigation Plans

Identify potential problems and solutions:

**Technical Risks:**

- Risk: Breaking changes too extensive, examples can't be easily migrated
  - Mitigation: Incremental testing, provide migration examples, consider backward-compatible alternatives
- Risk: New version not stable yet
  - Mitigation: Target only LTS/stable releases, avoid beta versions
- Risk: Third-party libraries incompatible with new versions
  - Mitigation: Research compatibility early, plan alternative examples

**Scope Risks:**

- Risk: Revision scope creeps beyond original plan
  - Mitigation: Strict scope control, defer enhancements to future edition, track scope changes
- Risk: Underestimating effort for "simple" chapters
  - Mitigation: Add 20% buffer to estimates, track actual time

**Schedule Risks:**

- Risk: Testing takes longer than expected
  - Mitigation: Start testing early, test incrementally, run tests in parallel
- Risk: Publisher deadline pressure
  - Mitigation: Build buffer time into schedule, prioritize critical updates, communicate early if slipping

**Quality Risks:**

- Risk: Inconsistency between old and new content
  - Mitigation: Extract style guide early, editorial review, use existing-book-integration-checklist.md
- Risk: Breaking learning flow with changes
  - Mitigation: Review learning progression, test with beta readers, consult instructional designer

### 10. Generate Revision Plan

Use the create-doc.md task with revision-plan-tmpl.yaml template to create the structured revision plan document.

The plan should include all decisions and details from steps 1-9.

### 11. Validate Revision Plan

Run execute-checklist.md with revision-completeness-checklist.md to ensure:

- All aspects of revision are planned
- Timeline is realistic
- Dependencies are identified
- Risks are assessed
- Success criteria are clear

### 12. Review and Approve

Review the revision plan with stakeholders:

- Author: Is the timeline realistic? Are priorities correct?
- Publisher: Does this meet publication requirements?
- Technical reviewer: Are technical estimates accurate?
- Instructional designer: Will learning flow be maintained?

Get formal approval before starting revision work.

## Success Criteria

A completed revision plan should have:

- [ ] Clear revision scope and type defined
- [ ] All technology version changes documented
- [ ] Chapter revision matrix complete with priorities
- [ ] Learning flow impact assessed
- [ ] Code testing strategy defined
- [ ] Timeline with phases and milestones
- [ ] Critical path and dependencies identified
- [ ] Success criteria clearly stated
- [ ] Risks assessed with mitigation plans
- [ ] Revision plan document generated
- [ ] Stakeholder approval secured

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Underestimating effort**: Revisions often take longer than expected - add buffer
- **Ignoring learning flow**: Changes in early chapters affect later ones
- **No testing plan**: Can't verify quality without systematic testing
- **Vague success criteria**: Must define "done" explicitly
- **Skipping risk assessment**: Surprises derail timelines
- **No stakeholder buy-in**: Get approval before starting work

## Next Steps

After completing the revision plan:

1. Set up testing environment and code repository
2. Begin chapter revisions following priority order
3. Extract code patterns if needed (extract-code-patterns.md)
4. Execute book-edition-update-workflow.yaml for full coordination
5. Track progress against timeline and adjust as needed

- Spacing: Blank lines between groups?
- Format: `import os` vs `from os import path`?

**Example Pattern Found:**

```python
# Standard library imports (alphabetical)
import json
import os
from pathlib import Path

# Third-party imports (alphabetical)
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from flask import Flask, request

# Local imports
from .models import User
from .utils import validate_email
```

**JavaScript Import Patterns:**

- CommonJS vs ESM?
- Named imports vs default imports?
- Import order conventions?

Document the pattern consistently used throughout the book.

### 3. Note Naming Conventions

Extract naming patterns used:

**Variables:**

- snake_case, camelCase, or PascalCase?
- Descriptive names or short names?
- Any prefixes? (e.g., `str_name`, `is_valid`, `has_permission`)

**Functions:**

- Naming style? (snake_case for Python, camelCase for JavaScript?)
- Verb-based names? (get_user, calculate_total, validate_input)
- Prefix patterns? (is_valid, has_items, can_delete)

**Classes:**

- PascalCase? (UserAccount, DatabaseConnection)
- Singular vs plural? (User vs Users)
- Suffix patterns? (UserManager, DataProcessor, HTMLRenderer)

**Constants:**

- UPPER_SNAKE_CASE?
- Placement? (top of file? separate config file?)

**Example Pattern Found:**

```python
# Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
MAX_RETRIES = 3
DEFAULT_TIMEOUT = 30

# Functions: snake_case, verb-based
def calculate_total(items):
    pass

def is_valid_email(email):
    pass

# Classes: PascalCase, singular nouns
class UserAccount:
    pass

class DatabaseConnection:
    pass
```

### 4. Observe Comment Styles

Analyze commenting patterns:

**Docstrings:**

- Present? (always, sometimes, rarely?)
- Format? (Google style, NumPy style, Sphinx style?)
- What's documented? (all functions? only public APIs?)

**Inline Comments:**

- Frequency? (heavy, moderate, minimal?)
- Style? (full sentences? fragments? end-of-line? above code?)
- Purpose? (explain why? explain what? both?)

**File Headers:**

- Module docstrings?
- Author, date, description?
- License information?

**Example Pattern Found:**

```python
def calculate_discount(price, discount_percent):
    """
    Calculate discounted price.

    Args:
        price (float): Original price
        discount_percent (float): Discount percentage (0-100)

    Returns:
        float: Discounted price
    """
    # Convert percentage to decimal
    discount_decimal = discount_percent / 100

    # Apply discount
    return price * (1 - discount_decimal)
```

### 5. Extract Error Handling Patterns

Identify error handling approaches:

**Exception Handling:**

- try/except usage frequency?
- Specific exceptions caught or broad Exception?
- Error message style?
- Logging patterns?
- Re-raising exceptions?

**Validation:**

- Input validation at function start?
- Assertions used?
- Guard clauses?

**Example Pattern Found:**

```python
def process_user(user_id):
    """Process user with comprehensive error handling."""
    if not user_id:
        raise ValueError("user_id is required")

    try:
        user = User.objects.get(id=user_id)
    except User.DoesNotExist:
        logger.error(f"User {user_id} not found")
        return None
    except DatabaseError as e:
        logger.error(f"Database error: {e}")
        raise

    return user
```

### 6. Identify Code Structure Patterns

Analyze overall code organization:

**Programming Paradigm:**

- Object-oriented? (classes, inheritance, polymorphism)
- Functional? (pure functions, immutability, higher-order functions)
- Procedural? (step-by-step scripts)
- Mixed? (where and why?)

**Design Patterns:**

- Any common patterns? (Factory, Singleton, Observer, etc.)
- Consistent pattern usage across examples?

**Code Organization:**

- File structure patterns?
- Class organization patterns (properties‚Üíinit‚Üípublic‚Üíprivate)?
- Module organization patterns?

**Example Pattern Found:**

```
File organization:
1. Module docstring
2. Imports (stdlib, third-party, local)
3. Constants
4. Helper functions
5. Main classes
6. if __name__ == '__main__' block
```

### 7. Note Formatting Choices

Document formatting standards:

**Indentation:**

- Spaces or tabs? (Python: 4 spaces is PEP 8)
- Consistent indentation levels?

**Line Length:**

- Maximum line length? (79, 88, 100, 120 chars?)
- Line breaking style?

**Spacing:**

- Blank lines between functions? (2 for top-level, 1 for methods?)
- Spacing around operators? (a + b vs a+b)
- Spacing in function calls? (func(a, b) vs func( a, b ))

**Quotes:**

- Single or double quotes?
- Consistency?

**Example Pattern Found:**

```
- Indentation: 4 spaces (never tabs)
- Line length: 88 characters maximum
- Blank lines: 2 between top-level definitions, 1 between methods
- Quotes: Double quotes for strings, single for identifiers
- Operators: Spaces around (x = y + 2, not x=y+2)
```

### 8. Document Code File Organization

Identify file structure patterns:

**Import Section:**

- Always at top?
- Grouped and ordered how?

**Constants Section:**

- After imports?
- Separate section?

**Class Definitions:**

- Order? (base classes first? main classes first?)
- Internal organization? (properties‚Üí**init**‚Üípublic‚Üíprivate?)

**Main Execution:**

- `if __name__ == '__main__'` block?
- main() function pattern?

**Example Pattern Found:**

```python
# 1. Module docstring
"""
Module for user authentication.
"""

# 2. Imports
import os
from typing import Optional

# 3. Constants
DEFAULT_TIMEOUT = 30

# 4. Helper functions
def _internal_helper():
    pass

# 5. Main classes
class UserAuth:
    pass

# 6. Main execution
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### 9. Analyze Code Complexity Patterns

Understand example complexity distribution:

**Simple Snippets:**

- How many? (percentage of total examples)
- Purpose? (demonstrate single concept)
- Typical length? (5-10 lines)

**Medium Examples:**

- How many?
- Purpose? (demonstrate technique in context)
- Typical length? (20-50 lines)

**Complete Projects:**

- How many?
- Purpose? (demonstrate full application)
- Typical length? (100+ lines, multiple files)

This helps maintain appropriate complexity when adding new examples.

### 10. Generate Style Guide Summary

Create comprehensive code-patterns.md document with all findings:

```markdown
# Code Style Patterns for [Book Title]

## Import Organization

[Document pattern]

## Naming Conventions

[Document pattern]

## Comment Styles

[Document pattern]

## Error Handling

[Document pattern]

## Code Structure

[Document pattern]

## Formatting

[Document pattern]

## File Organization

[Document pattern]

## Complexity Guidelines

[Document pattern]

## Examples

[Provide examples of well-styled code from the book]
```

This document becomes the reference for all new/updated code.

### 11. Validate with Integration Checklist

Run execute-checklist.md with existing-book-integration-checklist.md to ensure:

- Code patterns are comprehensive
- Patterns are consistent across book
- Examples are clear and representative
- New code can match extracted patterns

## Success Criteria

A completed code pattern extraction should have:

- [ ] All code examples analyzed
- [ ] Import patterns documented
- [ ] Naming conventions extracted
- [ ] Comment styles identified
- [ ] Error handling patterns noted
- [ ] Code structure patterns documented
- [ ] Formatting choices specified
- [ ] File organization patterns defined
- [ ] Complexity patterns understood
- [ ] Comprehensive style guide created
- [ ] Integration checklist passed

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Inconsistency analysis**: If book has inconsistent patterns, document the _most common_ pattern and note variations
- **Over-specificity**: Extract patterns, not rigid rules that prevent good code
- **Ignoring context**: Some chapters may intentionally use different patterns (e.g., teaching different styles)
- **Missing examples**: Include code examples in style guide for clarity

## Next Steps

After extracting code patterns:

1. Use style guide when writing new code examples
2. Apply patterns when updating existing code
3. Share style guide with technical reviewers
4. Reference in existing-book-integration-checklist.md
5. Update style guide if patterns evolve

# Incorporate Reviewer Feedback

---

task:
id: incorporate-reviewer-feedback
name: Systematically Incorporate Reviewer Feedback
description: Process and address technical reviewer, publisher, and beta reader feedback systematically
persona_default: book-analyst
inputs:

- reviewer_feedback (technical review comments, publisher requests, beta reader notes)
- affected_chapters
  steps:
- Collect all reviewer feedback from all sources (technical, publisher, beta readers)
- Categorize feedback by severity (critical/must-fix, important/should-fix, optional/nice-to-have)
- Create feedback tracking log with status for each item
- Address critical issues first (technical errors, broken code, security issues)
- Fix important issues (clarity problems, missing examples, structural issues)
- Consider optional suggestions (enhancements, additional topics, style preferences)
- Test all code changes from feedback
- Update text for clarity improvements requested
- Track completion status in feedback log

  output: docs/feedback/{{book_title}}-feedback-resolution-log.md

---

## Purpose

This task provides a systematic approach to processing reviewer feedback from technical reviewers, publishers, and beta readers. Ensures all feedback is triaged, addressed appropriately, and tracked to completion.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this task:

- Reviewer feedback collected from all sources
- Chapters are in reviewable state
- Testing environment set up for code changes
- Understanding of feedback priorities (which issues are critical)

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Collect All Reviewer Feedback

Gather feedback from all sources:

**Technical Reviewer Feedback:**

- Technical accuracy issues
- Code errors or improvements
- Misleading explanations
- Missing prerequisites
- Incorrect terminology

**Publisher Feedback:**

- Format compliance issues
- Style guide violations
- Length adjustments needed
- Market positioning changes
- Legal/licensing concerns

**Beta Reader Feedback:**

- Clarity problems
- Confusing sections
- Missing examples
- Difficulty level issues
- Typos and errors

Consolidate into a single master feedback list.

### 2. Categorize Feedback by Severity

Triage each feedback item into priority categories:

**Critical (Must-Fix):**

- Technical errors (incorrect information)
- Broken code examples (won't run)
- Security vulnerabilities
- Legal/licensing issues
- Publisher blocking issues (won't publish without fix)
- Major clarity problems (readers can't follow)

**Important (Should-Fix):**

- Unclear explanations (could be clearer)
- Missing examples (would help understanding)
- Structural issues (better organization possible)
- Incomplete coverage (topic needs expansion)
- Style inconsistencies
- Minor technical inaccuracies

**Nice-to-Have (Optional):**

- Style preferences (subjective improvements)
- Additional topics (scope expansion)
- Enhancement suggestions
- Alternative explanations
- Personal preferences

### 3. Create Feedback Tracking Log

Build a structured tracking system:

| ID   | Chapter | Severity  | Issue                      | Requested By | Status   | Resolution     | Date       |
| ---- | ------- | --------- | -------------------------- | ------------ | -------- | -------------- | ---------- |
| F001 | Ch 3    | Critical  | Code won't run Python 3.12 | Tech Review  | Done     | Fixed import   | 2024-01-15 |
| F002 | Ch 5    | Important | Unclear JWT explanation    | Beta Reader  | Done     | Added example  | 2024-01-16 |
| F003 | Ch 7    | Optional  | Add async/await example    | Tech Review  | Deferred | Future edition | 2024-01-16 |

This provides visibility into progress and ensures nothing is missed.

### 4. Address Critical Issues First

Start with must-fix items:

**For Technical Errors:**

- Verify the error (confirm it's incorrect)
- Research the correct information
- Update text and code
- Test updated code
- Add verification note to tracking log

**For Broken Code:**

- Reproduce the issue
- Fix the code
- Test on target version(s)
- Verify output is correct
- Update text if output changed

**For Security Issues:**

- Assess severity (CVSS score if applicable)
- Fix immediately
- Add security note if appropriate
- Test fix thoroughly
- Document in change log

**For Publisher Blocking Issues:**

- Understand exact requirement
- Implement change
- Verify compliance
- Get publisher confirmation
- Mark resolved

Do not proceed to lower-priority items until all critical issues are resolved.

### 5. Fix Important Issues

Address should-fix items systematically:

**For Clarity Problems:**

- Identify specific unclear section
- Rewrite for clarity
- Add examples if needed
- Get second opinion (beta reader, colleague)
- Update tracking log

**For Missing Examples:**

- Understand what example is needed
- Design example that teaches the concept
- Write and test code
- Integrate into chapter
- Verify it improves understanding

**For Structural Issues:**

- Assess reorganization impact
- Plan structural change
- Reorganize content
- Update cross-references
- Verify learning flow still works

**For Incomplete Coverage:**

- Determine scope of addition
- Write additional content
- Test any new code
- Integrate smoothly
- Ensure doesn't bloat chapter excessively

### 6. Consider Optional Suggestions

Evaluate nice-to-have items carefully:

**Decision Criteria:**

- Does it improve reader experience?
- Is it within scope of current edition?
- Do I have time/space for this?
- Does it align with book goals?

**Actions:**

- **Implement**: If valuable and feasible
- **Defer**: If good idea but not for this edition (document for next edition)
- **Decline**: If not aligned with book goals (document reason)

Document all decisions in tracking log, even for declined items.

### 7. Test All Code Changes

For every code change made from feedback:

- Test code runs successfully
- Test on target version(s)
- Verify output matches text
- Check for new errors or warnings
- Run regression tests (ensure other examples still work)
- Update code repository

No code changes should be marked complete without testing.

### 8. Update Text for Clarity

For text improvements from feedback:

- Rewrite unclear sections
- Add clarifying examples
- Improve explanations
- Fix terminology inconsistencies
- Verify technical accuracy
- Ensure voice/tone consistency

Use extracted code patterns and style guide to maintain consistency.

### 9. Track Completion Status

Update feedback tracking log continuously:

- Mark items as "In Progress" when starting
- Mark as "Done" when complete and tested
- Mark as "Deferred" if postponing to next edition
- Mark as "Declined" if not implementing (with reason)
- Add completion date
- Add resolution notes

This creates accountability and progress visibility.

### 10. Generate Feedback Resolution Log

Create comprehensive document summarizing all feedback processing:

```markdown
# Feedback Resolution Log - [Book Title]

## Summary

- Total feedback items: 47
- Critical (resolved): 8/8
- Important (resolved): 23/25 (2 deferred)
- Optional (resolved): 7/14 (4 deferred, 3 declined)

## Critical Issues Resolved

[List with details]

## Important Issues Resolved

[List with details]

## Deferred Items

[List with rationale and target edition]

## Declined Items

[List with rationale]

## Code Changes

[List all code changes made]

## Text Changes

[List major text revisions]

## Reviewer Acknowledgments

[Thank reviewers]
```

This document provides transparency and completeness.

### 11. Run Integration Checklist

Use execute-checklist.md with existing-book-integration-checklist.md to ensure:

- Changes maintain consistency with existing content
- Voice and tone are consistent
- Code patterns are followed
- Cross-references are accurate
- Learning flow is maintained

## Success Criteria

A completed feedback incorporation should have:

- [ ] All feedback collected from all sources
- [ ] Feedback categorized by severity
- [ ] Tracking log created and maintained
- [ ] All critical issues resolved
- [ ] All important issues addressed or consciously deferred
- [ ] Optional items evaluated (implement, defer, or decline)
- [ ] All code changes tested
- [ ] Text clarity improvements made
- [ ] Completion status tracked for every item
- [ ] Feedback resolution log generated
- [ ] Integration checklist passed
- [ ] No blocking issues remain

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Ignoring low-severity feedback**: Track and evaluate all feedback, even if declining
- **No prioritization**: Must address critical items first
- **Scope creep**: Optional items can expand scope significantly - be disciplined
- **Poor tracking**: Without tracking, items get missed
- **Untested changes**: All code changes must be tested
- **Inconsistent voice**: Text changes must match existing style
- **No documentation**: Document what changed and why

## Next Steps

After incorporating feedback:

1. Send resolution log to reviewers for confirmation
2. Request final approval from technical reviewer
3. Get publisher sign-off on critical fixes
4. Proceed to final editorial review
5. Prepare for publication
6. Archive deferred items for next edition planning

id: execute-checklist
name: Execute Checklist
description: Systematically execute checklist items with pass/fail/na status and evidence collection for quality assurance
persona_default: technical-reviewer
inputs:

- checklist_path
- subject_name
- context_notes
  steps:
- Load and parse checklist file
- Process each category and item sequentially
- Evaluate and mark status (PASS/FAIL/NA) with evidence
- Generate results report with summary statistics
- Save results to standard location
  output: reviews/checklist-results/{{checklist-name}}-{{timestamp}}.md

---

## Purpose

This task provides a structured way to execute quality checklists and document results. It ensures all checklist items are systematically evaluated with evidence, creating an auditable record of quality gate execution.

## Prerequisites

- Checklist file exists and is accessible
- Subject material to be reviewed is available
- Understanding of checklist criteria
- Authority to evaluate against checklist standards

## Inputs

**Required:**

- `checklist_path`: Path to the checklist markdown file (e.g., `checklists/code-quality-checklist.md`)
- `subject_name`: Descriptive name of what's being checked (e.g., "Chapter 3: Database Design", "User Authentication Module")

**Optional:**

- `context_notes`: Additional context for the review (e.g., "First draft", "Post-revision", "Version 2.0 update")

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Load Checklist File

Load and parse the checklist:

- Read the checklist file from `checklist_path`
- Identify all categories (markdown H2 headings)
- Extract all checklist items (lines starting with `- [ ]`)
- Count total items for summary statistics
- Verify checklist structure is valid

**Validation:**

- File exists and is readable
- Contains at least one category
- Contains at least one checklist item
- Items follow standard markdown checkbox format

### 2. Initialize Results Document

Create the results file structure:

- Generate timestamp for unique filename
- Extract checklist name from file path
- Create results file path: `reviews/checklist-results/{{checklist-name}}-{{timestamp}}.md`
- Initialize document with header information:
  - Subject name
  - Date and time
  - Checklist source path
  - Context notes (if provided)

**Note:** Results are saved incrementally as you progress through the checklist.

### 3. Process Each Category

Work through checklist categories systematically:

For each category (H2 section):

1. **Announce category**: State which category you're evaluating
2. **Read all items in category**: Get overview of what's being checked
3. **Process items sequentially**: Work through each checkbox item

**Process Flow:**

- Category 1 ‚Üí All items ‚Üí Results saved
- Category 2 ‚Üí All items ‚Üí Results saved
- Continue until all categories complete

### 4. Evaluate Each Checklist Item

For each checklist item, perform systematic evaluation:

**Evaluation Process:**

1. **Read the item**: Understand what's being checked
2. **Examine the subject**: Review relevant content/code/documentation
3. **Make determination**: Decide on status
4. **Document evidence**: Record specific findings

**Status Values:**

- **‚úÖ PASS**: Item meets criteria fully
  - Provide brief evidence or write "Confirmed"
  - Example: "All code examples follow PEP 8 style guide"

- **‚ùå FAIL**: Item does not meet criteria
  - Document specific issue found
  - Explain why it fails
  - Provide recommendation for fix
  - Example: "Function `calculateTotal` missing error handling for empty cart scenario. Add validation before processing."

- **‚äò N/A**: Item not applicable to this subject
  - Explain why it doesn't apply
  - Example: "No JavaScript code in this chapter, checklist item not applicable"

**Evidence Requirements:**

- PASS: Brief confirmation or location reference
- FAIL: Detailed explanation with location and recommendation
- N/A: Reason for non-applicability

### 5. Handle Failed Items

When checklist item fails:

**Document Failure:**

- Mark status as ‚ùå FAIL
- Record specific location of issue (section, file, line number)
- Describe what was found vs what was expected
- Provide actionable recommendation for fixing

**Continue Execution:**

- Do NOT halt on failures (except critical issues - see below)
- Continue through all remaining items
- Capture complete picture of all issues

**Halt Immediately Only For:**

- Critical security vulnerabilities (exposed credentials, SQL injection)
- Data loss risks or corruption
- Legal/compliance violations
- Plagiarism or copyright infringement

If you encounter a halt-worthy issue:

1. Mark the item as ‚ùå FAIL with detailed explanation
2. Note "CRITICAL ISSUE - EXECUTION HALTED" in results
3. Stop checklist execution
4. Alert user immediately

### 6. Generate Summary Statistics

After all items processed (or if halted):

Calculate and include:

- **Total Items**: Count of all checklist items
- **Passed**: Count and percentage of PASS items
- **Failed**: Count and percentage of FAIL items
- **N/A**: Count and percentage of N/A items
- **Completion**: Percentage of applicable items that passed

**Overall Status Determination:**

- **PASS**: All applicable items passed (100% of PASS/(PASS+FAIL))
- **PASS WITH CONCERNS**: 80-99% pass rate, minor issues present
- **FAIL**: Less than 80% pass rate, significant issues present
- **CRITICAL FAILURE**: Execution halted due to critical issue

### 7. Create Failed Items Priority Section

If any items failed:

Create a dedicated section listing all failures:

**For Each Failed Item:**

- Category and item text
- Status: FAIL
- Evidence: Full details of what was found
- Location: Specific reference (section, file, line)
- Recommendation: How to fix the issue
- Priority: Based on severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)

**Purpose:** Provides quick reference for remediation work

### 8. Add Recommendations

Include actionable next steps:

**Recommendations based on overall status:**

- **PASS**: Subject meets all checklist criteria, ready to proceed
- **PASS WITH CONCERNS**: Address failed items before final approval
- **FAIL**: Must address all failures before proceeding
- **CRITICAL FAILURE**: Stop all work, address critical issue immediately

**Include:**

- Priority order for addressing failures
- Estimated effort for remediation
- Suggested next steps in workflow

### 9. Save Results

Save the complete results document:

- Write to `reviews/checklist-results/{{checklist-name}}-{{timestamp}}.md`
- Ensure directory exists (create if needed)
- Verify file was written successfully
- Provide user with results file path

**Results file includes:**

- Header with metadata
- Summary statistics
- Results by category (table format)
- Failed items priority section
- Recommendations
- Timestamp and audit trail

## Output Format

Results file structure:

```markdown
# Checklist Results: {{checklist-name}}

**Subject**: {{subject_name}}
**Date**: {{timestamp}}
**Checklist**: {{checklist_path}}
**Context**: {{context_notes}}

## Summary

- **Total Items**: 25
- **Passed**: 20 (80%)
- **Failed**: 3 (12%)
- **N/A**: 2 (8%)
- **Completion**: 87% (20/23 applicable items passed)
- **Overall Status**: PASS WITH CONCERNS

## Results by Category

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Checklist file not found

- Verify file path is correct relative to project root
- Check file extension is `.md`
- Ensure file exists in expected location

**Issue**: No checklist items detected

- Verify checklist uses standard markdown checkbox format: `- [ ] Item text`
- Check for proper category headings (H2: `## Category Name`)
- Ensure file is not empty or malformed

**Issue**: Unclear how to evaluate item

- Read item carefully and interpret based on context
- Refer to subject material being reviewed
- If truly ambiguous, mark as N/A and note ambiguity in evidence
- Consider consulting checklist owner or subject matter expert

**Issue**: Too many failures to track

- Continue execution, document all failures
- Use Failed Items Priority Section to organize
- Consider if subject needs major rework before continuing
- May indicate checklist mismatch with subject maturity

**Issue**: Results directory doesn't exist

- Create `reviews/checklist-results/` directory structure
- Ensure write permissions
- Verify project root location

## Integration with Workflows

This task is used in quality gates across workflows:

- **Section Development Workflow**: Technical review checkpoint
- **Chapter Assembly Workflow**: Completeness validation
- **Book Planning Workflow**: Proposal and outline validation
- **Publishing Workflows**: Publisher-specific submission requirements
- **Code Repository Workflow**: Code quality validation

## Next Steps

After checklist execution:

1. **If PASS**: Proceed to next workflow step
2. **If PASS WITH CONCERNS**: Review failed items, decide on remediation
3. **If FAIL**: Address failures before proceeding
4. **If CRITICAL FAILURE**: Stop all work, escalate issue

The results file provides an auditable record for:

- Workflow progression decisions
- Quality assurance tracking
- Team communication
- Process improvement analysis

# Version Update Quality Checklist

Use this checklist when updating a chapter for a new technology version (e.g., Python 3.9 ‚Üí 3.12, Node 16 ‚Üí 20).

## Import Statements

- [ ] All import statements reviewed for version compatibility
- [ ] Deprecated import paths updated to current equivalents
- [ ] New import patterns adopted where applicable (e.g., Python 3.10+ built-in generics)
- [ ] Import organization follows existing book patterns
- [ ] No warnings about deprecated imports when code runs

## Deprecated Methods/APIs

- [ ] All deprecated methods identified and replaced
- [ ] Replacement methods functionally equivalent
- [ ] Breaking changes addressed (behavior differences handled)
- [ ] Deprecation warnings eliminated
- [ ] Documentation links updated to current API docs

## New Syntax Features

- [ ] New syntax features considered for adoption (match/case, type hints, etc.)
- [ ] New syntax used only where pedagogically appropriate
- [ ] New syntax doesn't obscure the concept being taught
- [ ] Explanatory text updated to explain new syntax
- [ ] Syntax level appropriate for target audience

## Code Testing

- [ ] All code examples tested on exact target version
- [ ] Code runs without errors
- [ ] Code runs without warnings (or warnings are explained)
- [ ] Output matches what's shown in book text
- [ ] Code tested on all relevant platforms (if multi-platform book)
- [ ] Edge cases tested
- [ ] Performance characteristics verified (if performance-sensitive)

## Text Accuracy

- [ ] Version references updated throughout (Python 3.12, not 3.9)
- [ ] Explanations revised for any behavior changes
- [ ] Best practices updated to reflect current standards
- [ ] Security guidance current for target version
- [ ] Performance notes updated if characteristics changed
- [ ] Feature availability notes accurate (when features were introduced)

## Migration Notes

- [ ] Migration notes added if changes are significant
- [ ] Breaking changes documented
- [ ] Migration tips provided for readers with old code
- [ ] Links to official migration guides included (if helpful)
- [ ] Backward compatibility notes where relevant

## Cross-References

- [ ] All "see Chapter X" references still accurate
- [ ] Section number references verified
- [ ] Forward references still correct
- [ ] Backward references still correct
- [ ] Page number references updated (if present)
- [ ] Index entries reflect version changes

## Version-Specific Content

- [ ] Version-specific features clearly noted
- [ ] Minimum version requirements stated
- [ ] Version compatibility ranges specified where needed
- [ ] Deprecated features marked clearly
- [ ] Future deprecation warnings included where known

## Consistency

- [ ] Updated code follows extracted code patterns
- [ ] Voice and tone consistent with existing content
- [ ] Terminology consistent throughout chapter
- [ ] Formatting matches book standards

## Examples of Good Version Updates

**‚úÖ Good Update:**

```python
# Python 3.12 - Modern Type Hints
def process_items(items: list[str]) -> dict[str, int]:
    """Process items and return counts (Python 3.9+)."""
    return {item: items.count(item) for item in set(items)}
```

- Uses modern syntax
- Documents minimum version
- Clear and concise

**‚ùå Bad Update:**

```python
# Just changed version number but code uses old syntax
def process_items(items: List[str]) -> Dict[str, int]:
    # Still importing from typing (old way)
    return {item: items.count(item) for item in set(items)}
```

- Inconsistent (claims new version but uses old syntax)
- Missed opportunity to demonstrate new features

## Red Flags

- Version number changed in text but code unchanged
- Code uses deprecated features without migration plan
- No testing on actual target version
- Breaking changes ignored
- Cross-references broken by chapter renumbering
- Inconsistent version references (some old, some new)

## Setting Up Authentication

As we saw in Chapter 3, user authentication is critical for secure applications.
In this section, we'll implement JWT-based authentication using Flask.

> **Note**: JWT tokens should always include an expiration time to limit
> security exposure.

```python
from flask import Flask, request
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def create_token(user_id):
    """

````

- Matches voice/tone
- Follows cross-reference style
- Uses consistent callout format
- Follows code patterns (imports, docstring style)

**‚ùå Bad Integration:**

```markdown
# Auth Setup

Let's do authentication now!

**IMPORTANT!!!** Don't forget expiration!

from flask import \*
def make_token(uid): # make the token
```

- Heading style different (# vs ##)
- Voice too casual/inconsistent
- Callout style different (bold vs. callout box)
- Code style inconsistent (import \*, no docstring, different naming)

## Red Flags

- New content "feels different" when reading sequentially
- Reviewers comment on inconsistency
- Different terminology for same concepts
- Code style visibly different
- Heading styles don't match
- Callout formats vary
- Cross-references styled differently
- Learning difficulty jumps unexpectedly

# Learning Frameworks for Technical Writing

This document provides pedagogical frameworks essential for designing effective technical books and tutorials.

## Bloom's Taxonomy

Bloom's Taxonomy provides a hierarchy of cognitive skills from simple recall to complex creation. Use it to design learning progression and create appropriate learning objectives.

### The Six Levels

#### 1. Remember (Lowest Level)

**Description:** Recall facts, terms, basic concepts

**Action Verbs:**

- List, Define, Name, Identify, Label
- Describe, Recognize, Recall, State

**Example Learning Objectives:**

- "List the main HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)"
- "Identify the components of a REST API"
- "Define what JWT authentication means"

**Assessment:** Multiple choice, matching, simple recall questions

---

#### 2. Understand

**Description:** Explain ideas or concepts

**Action Verbs:**

- Explain, Describe, Summarize, Interpret
- Compare, Classify, Discuss, Paraphrase

**Example Learning Objectives:**

- "Explain how JWT tokens provide stateless authentication"
- "Describe the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code"
- "Summarize the benefits of using TypeScript over JavaScript"

**Assessment:** Short answer explanations, concept mapping

---

#### 3. Apply

**Description:** Use information in new situations

**Action Verbs:**

- Implement, Execute, Use, Apply
- Demonstrate, Build, Solve, Show

**Example Learning Objectives:**

- "Implement user authentication using Passport.js"
- "Build a REST API with CRUD operations"
- "Use async/await to handle asynchronous operations"

**Assessment:** Coding exercises, hands-on projects

---

#### 4. Analyze

**Description:** Draw connections, distinguish between parts

**Action Verbs:**

- Analyze, Compare, Contrast, Examine
- Debug, Troubleshoot, Differentiate, Investigate

**Example Learning Objectives:**

- "Analyze database query performance using EXPLAIN"
- "Debug memory leaks in Node.js applications"
- "Compare SQL vs NoSQL for specific use cases"

**Assessment:** Debugging tasks, performance analysis, case studies

---

#### 5. Evaluate

**Description:** Justify decisions, make judgments

**Action Verbs:**

- Evaluate, Assess, Critique, Judge
- Optimize, Recommend, Justify, Argue

**Example Learning Objectives:**

- "Evaluate trade-offs between different caching strategies"
- "Assess security vulnerabilities using OWASP guidelines"
- "Optimize API response times through profiling"

**Assessment:** Code reviews, architecture critiques, optimization challenges

---

#### 6. Create (Highest Level)

**Description:** Produce new or original work

**Action Verbs:**

- Design, Develop, Create, Construct
- Architect, Formulate, Author, Devise

**Example Learning Objectives:**

- "Design a scalable microservices architecture"
- "Develop a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment"
- "Create a custom authentication system with MFA"

**Assessment:** Original projects, system design, architectural proposals

---

### Applying Bloom's to Book Structure

**Early Chapters (Remember + Understand):**

- Define terminology
- Explain core concepts
- Simple examples

**Middle Chapters (Apply + Analyze):**

- Hands-on implementation
- Debugging exercises
- Comparative analysis

**Late Chapters (Evaluate + Create):**

- Optimization challenges
- Design decisions
- Original projects

---

## Scaffolding Principles

Scaffolding provides temporary support structures that help learners achieve more than they could independently, then gradually removes support as competence grows.

### Core Principles

#### 1. Start with Concrete Examples

- Show working code first
- Use real-world scenarios
- Demonstrate before explaining theory
- Tangible results build confidence

**Example:**

```
‚ùå Poor: "RESTful APIs follow stateless client-server architecture..."
‚úÖ Better: "Here's a working API endpoint. Let's see what happens when we call it, then understand why it works this way."
```

#### 2. Progress to Abstract Concepts

- After concrete understanding, introduce theory
- Connect examples to general principles
- Explain underlying concepts
- Build mental models

**Progression:**

1. Working example
2. What it does (concrete)
3. How it works (mechanism)
4. Why it works (theory)
5. When to use it (application)

#### 3. Build on Prior Knowledge

- Explicitly state prerequisites
- Reference previous chapters
- Activate existing knowledge
- Connect new to known

**Example:**

```
"In Chapter 3, we learned about promises. Async/await is syntactic sugar that makes promises easier to work with..."
```

#### 4. Gradual Complexity Increase

- Start simple, add features incrementally
- Introduce one new concept at a time
- Build up to complex examples
- Avoid overwhelming cognitive load

**Progressive Build:**

1. Basic function
2. Add error handling
3. Add logging
4. Add caching
5. Add advanced features

#### 5. Guided ‚Üí Independent Practice

- Start with step-by-step tutorials
- Reduce guidance gradually
- End with independent challenges
- Build reader confidence

**Practice Progression:**

1. **Guided**: "Follow these steps exactly..."
2. **Partial guidance**: "Now implement X using the same pattern..."
3. **Independent**: "Build feature Y on your own..."
4. **Challenge**: "Design and implement Z..."

## Cognitive Load Management

Cognitive Load Theory explains how working memory limitations affect learning. Technical books must manage cognitive load carefully.

### Types of Cognitive Load

#### 1. Intrinsic Load

- Inherent difficulty of the material
- Cannot be reduced without changing content
- Manage by proper sequencing

**Strategy:** Break complex topics into smaller chunks

#### 2. Extraneous Load

- Unnecessary cognitive effort
- Caused by poor instruction design
- CAN and SHOULD be minimized

**Causes:**

- Confusing explanations
- Unclear code examples
- Missing context
- Poor organization

#### 3. Germane Load

- Effort required to build understanding
- Desirable difficulty
- Promotes schema construction

**Strategy:** Use exercises and practice that build understanding

### Cognitive Load Management Strategies

#### 1. Chunking Information

- Break content into digestible pieces
- Group related concepts together
- Use clear section headings
- Limit scope of each section

**Example:**

```
‚ùå Poor: One 40-page chapter on "Database Design"
‚úÖ Better: Four 10-page chapters: "Schema Design", "Indexing", "Normalization", "Optimization"
```

#### 2. Progressive Disclosure

- Introduce information when needed
- Don't front-load everything
- Just-in-time teaching
- Hide complexity until required

**Example:**

```
Chapter 1: Basic SQL queries (SELECT, WHERE)
Chapter 2: Joins and relationships
Chapter 3: Advanced queries (subqueries, CTEs)
Chapter 4: Optimization and indexes
```

#### 3. Worked Examples Before Practice

- Show complete solutions first
- Explain step-by-step
- Then ask readers to practice
- Reduces cognitive load of problem-solving while learning

**Pattern:**

1. Show complete example with explanation
2. Show similar example with partial explanation
3. Ask reader to complete similar task
4. Provide independent challenge

#### 4. Dual Coding (Text + Visual)

- Use diagrams to complement text
- Code examples with visual flow diagrams
- Screenshots of results
- Reduces cognitive load by distributing across channels

**Effective Visuals:**

- Architecture diagrams
- Flow charts
- Sequence diagrams
- Database schemas
- API request/response flows

---

## Adult Learning Principles

Adult learners have specific characteristics that affect technical book design.

### Key Principles

#### 1. Adults are Self-Directed

- Provide clear learning paths
- Explain the "why" not just "what"
- Allow exploration and experimentation
- Respect prior experience

**Application:**

- Clear objectives upfront
- Optional "deep dive" sections
- Multiple approaches shown
- Encourage adaptation to needs

#### 2. Adults Need Relevance

- Real-world examples
- Practical applications
- Career relevance
- Immediate applicability

**Application:**

- Start chapters with real-world problems
- Show industry use cases
- Explain job market demand
- Provide production-ready patterns

#### 3. Adults are Problem-Oriented

- Learn best through solving problems
- Prefer practical over theoretical
- Want working solutions
- Value hands-on practice

**Application:**

- Problem-based learning approach
- Tutorials over lectures
- Working code examples
- Real projects

#### 4. Adults Bring Experience

- Acknowledge existing knowledge
- Build on prior experience
- Allow knowledge transfer
- Respect diverse backgrounds

**Application:**

- State prerequisites clearly
- Reference common experiences
- Compare to known technologies
- Provide multiple analogies

---
