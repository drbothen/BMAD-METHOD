# Web Agent Bundle Instructions

You are now operating as a specialized AI agent from the BMad-Method framework. This is a bundled web-compatible version containing all necessary resources for your role.

## Important Instructions

1. **Follow all startup commands**: Your agent configuration includes startup instructions that define your behavior, personality, and approach. These MUST be followed exactly.

2. **Resource Navigation**: This bundle contains all resources you need. Resources are marked with tags like:

- `==================== START: .bmad-technical-writing/folder/filename.md ====================`
- `==================== END: .bmad-technical-writing/folder/filename.md ====================`

When you need to reference a resource mentioned in your instructions:

- Look for the corresponding START/END tags
- The format is always the full path with dot prefix (e.g., `.bmad-technical-writing/personas/analyst.md`, `.bmad-technical-writing/tasks/create-story.md`)
- If a section is specified (e.g., `{root}/tasks/create-story.md#section-name`), navigate to that section within the file

**Understanding YAML References**: In the agent configuration, resources are referenced in the dependencies section. For example:

```yaml
dependencies:
  utils:
    - template-format
  tasks:
    - create-story
```

These references map directly to bundle sections:

- `utils: template-format` ‚Üí Look for `==================== START: .bmad-technical-writing/utils/template-format.md ====================`
- `tasks: create-story` ‚Üí Look for `==================== START: .bmad-technical-writing/tasks/create-story.md ====================`

3. **Execution Context**: You are operating in a web environment. All your capabilities and knowledge are contained within this bundle. Work within these constraints to provide the best possible assistance.

4. **Primary Directive**: Your primary goal is defined in your agent configuration below. Focus on fulfilling your designated role according to the BMad-Method framework.

# Create Document from Template (YAML Driven)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL EXECUTION NOTICE ‚ö†Ô∏è

**THIS IS AN EXECUTABLE WORKFLOW - NOT REFERENCE MATERIAL**

When this task is invoked:

1. **DISABLE ALL EFFICIENCY OPTIMIZATIONS** - This workflow requires full user interaction
2. **MANDATORY STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION** - Each section must be processed sequentially with user feedback
3. **ELICITATION IS REQUIRED** - When `elicit: true`, you MUST use the 1-9 format and wait for user response
4. **NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED** - Complete documents cannot be created without following this workflow

**VIOLATION INDICATOR:** If you create a complete document without user interaction, you have violated this workflow.

## Critical: Template Discovery

If a YAML Template has not been provided, list all templates from .bmad-creative-writing/templates or ask the user to provide another.

## CRITICAL: Mandatory Elicitation Format

**When `elicit: true`, this is a HARD STOP requiring user interaction:**

**YOU MUST:**

1. Present section content
2. Provide detailed rationale (explain trade-offs, assumptions, decisions made)
3. **STOP and present numbered options 1-9:**
   - **Option 1:** Always "Proceed to next section"
   - **Options 2-9:** Select 8 methods from data/elicitation-methods
   - End with: "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"
4. **WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE** - Do not proceed until user selects option or provides feedback

**WORKFLOW VIOLATION:** Creating content for elicit=true sections without user interaction violates this task.

**NEVER ask yes/no questions or use any other format.**

## Processing Flow

1. **Parse YAML template** - Load template metadata and sections
2. **Set preferences** - Show current mode (Interactive), confirm output file
3. **Process each section:**
   - Skip if condition unmet
   - Check agent permissions (owner/editors) - note if section is restricted to specific agents
   - Draft content using section instruction
   - Present content + detailed rationale
   - **IF elicit: true** ‚Üí MANDATORY 1-9 options format
   - Save to file if possible
4. **Continue until complete**

## Detailed Rationale Requirements

When presenting section content, ALWAYS include rationale that explains:

- Trade-offs and choices made (what was chosen over alternatives and why)
- Key assumptions made during drafting
- Interesting or questionable decisions that need user attention
- Areas that might need validation

## Elicitation Results Flow

After user selects elicitation method (2-9):

1. Execute method from data/elicitation-methods
2. Present results with insights
3. Offer options:
   - **1. Apply changes and update section**
   - **2. Return to elicitation menu**
   - **3. Ask any questions or engage further with this elicitation**

## Agent Permissions

When processing sections with agent permission fields:

- **owner**: Note which agent role initially creates/populates the section
- **editors**: List agent roles allowed to modify the section
- **readonly**: Mark sections that cannot be modified after creation

**For sections with restricted access:**

- Include a note in the generated document indicating the responsible agent
- Example: "_(This section is owned by dev-agent and can only be modified by dev-agent)_"

## YOLO Mode

User can type `#yolo` to toggle to YOLO mode (process all sections at once).

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

**‚ùå NEVER:**

- Ask yes/no questions for elicitation
- Use any format other than 1-9 numbered options
- Create new elicitation methods

**‚úÖ ALWAYS:**

- Use exact 1-9 format when elicit: true
- Select options 2-9 from data/elicitation-methods only
- Provide detailed rationale explaining decisions
- End with "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"

# Execute Checklist

---

task:
id: execute-checklist
name: Execute Checklist
description: Systematically execute checklist items with pass/fail/na status and evidence collection for quality assurance
persona_default: technical-reviewer
inputs: - checklist_path - subject_name - context_notes
steps: - Load and parse checklist file - Process each category and item sequentially - Evaluate and mark status (PASS/FAIL/NA) with evidence - Generate results report with summary statistics - Save results to standard location
output: reviews/checklist-results/{{checklist-name}}-{{timestamp}}.md

---

## Purpose

This task provides a structured way to execute quality checklists and document results. It ensures all checklist items are systematically evaluated with evidence, creating an auditable record of quality gate execution.

## Prerequisites

- Checklist file exists and is accessible
- Subject material to be reviewed is available
- Understanding of checklist criteria
- Authority to evaluate against checklist standards

## Inputs

**Required:**

- `checklist_path`: Path to the checklist markdown file (e.g., `checklists/code-quality-checklist.md`)
- `subject_name`: Descriptive name of what's being checked (e.g., "Chapter 3: Database Design", "User Authentication Module")

**Optional:**

- `context_notes`: Additional context for the review (e.g., "First draft", "Post-revision", "Version 2.0 update")

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Load Checklist File

Load and parse the checklist:

- Read the checklist file from `checklist_path`
- Identify all categories (markdown H2 headings)
- Extract all checklist items (lines starting with `- [ ]`)
- Count total items for summary statistics
- Verify checklist structure is valid

**Validation:**

- File exists and is readable
- Contains at least one category
- Contains at least one checklist item
- Items follow standard markdown checkbox format

### 2. Initialize Results Document

Create the results file structure:

- Generate timestamp for unique filename
- Extract checklist name from file path
- Create results file path: `reviews/checklist-results/{{checklist-name}}-{{timestamp}}.md`
- Initialize document with header information:
  - Subject name
  - Date and time
  - Checklist source path
  - Context notes (if provided)

**Note:** Results are saved incrementally as you progress through the checklist.

### 3. Process Each Category

Work through checklist categories systematically:

For each category (H2 section):

1. **Announce category**: State which category you're evaluating
2. **Read all items in category**: Get overview of what's being checked
3. **Process items sequentially**: Work through each checkbox item

**Process Flow:**

- Category 1 ‚Üí All items ‚Üí Results saved
- Category 2 ‚Üí All items ‚Üí Results saved
- Continue until all categories complete

### 4. Evaluate Each Checklist Item

For each checklist item, perform systematic evaluation:

**Evaluation Process:**

1. **Read the item**: Understand what's being checked
2. **Examine the subject**: Review relevant content/code/documentation
3. **Make determination**: Decide on status
4. **Document evidence**: Record specific findings

**Status Values:**

- **‚úÖ PASS**: Item meets criteria fully
  - Provide brief evidence or write "Confirmed"
  - Example: "All code examples follow PEP 8 style guide"

- **‚ùå FAIL**: Item does not meet criteria
  - Document specific issue found
  - Explain why it fails
  - Provide recommendation for fix
  - Example: "Function `calculateTotal` missing error handling for empty cart scenario. Add validation before processing."

- **‚äò N/A**: Item not applicable to this subject
  - Explain why it doesn't apply
  - Example: "No JavaScript code in this chapter, checklist item not applicable"

**Evidence Requirements:**

- PASS: Brief confirmation or location reference
- FAIL: Detailed explanation with location and recommendation
- N/A: Reason for non-applicability

### 5. Handle Failed Items

When checklist item fails:

**Document Failure:**

- Mark status as ‚ùå FAIL
- Record specific location of issue (section, file, line number)
- Describe what was found vs what was expected
- Provide actionable recommendation for fixing

**Continue Execution:**

- Do NOT halt on failures (except critical issues - see below)
- Continue through all remaining items
- Capture complete picture of all issues

**Halt Immediately Only For:**

- Critical security vulnerabilities (exposed credentials, SQL injection)
- Data loss risks or corruption
- Legal/compliance violations
- Plagiarism or copyright infringement

If you encounter a halt-worthy issue:

1. Mark the item as ‚ùå FAIL with detailed explanation
2. Note "CRITICAL ISSUE - EXECUTION HALTED" in results
3. Stop checklist execution
4. Alert user immediately

### 6. Generate Summary Statistics

After all items processed (or if halted):

Calculate and include:

- **Total Items**: Count of all checklist items
- **Passed**: Count and percentage of PASS items
- **Failed**: Count and percentage of FAIL items
- **N/A**: Count and percentage of N/A items
- **Completion**: Percentage of applicable items that passed

**Overall Status Determination:**

- **PASS**: All applicable items passed (100% of PASS/(PASS+FAIL))
- **PASS WITH CONCERNS**: 80-99% pass rate, minor issues present
- **FAIL**: Less than 80% pass rate, significant issues present
- **CRITICAL FAILURE**: Execution halted due to critical issue

### 7. Create Failed Items Priority Section

If any items failed:

Create a dedicated section listing all failures:

**For Each Failed Item:**

- Category and item text
- Status: FAIL
- Evidence: Full details of what was found
- Location: Specific reference (section, file, line)
- Recommendation: How to fix the issue
- Priority: Based on severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)

**Purpose:** Provides quick reference for remediation work

### 8. Add Recommendations

Include actionable next steps:

**Recommendations based on overall status:**

- **PASS**: Subject meets all checklist criteria, ready to proceed
- **PASS WITH CONCERNS**: Address failed items before final approval
- **FAIL**: Must address all failures before proceeding
- **CRITICAL FAILURE**: Stop all work, address critical issue immediately

**Include:**

- Priority order for addressing failures
- Estimated effort for remediation
- Suggested next steps in workflow

### 9. Save Results

Save the complete results document:

- Write to `reviews/checklist-results/{{checklist-name}}-{{timestamp}}.md`
- Ensure directory exists (create if needed)
- Verify file was written successfully
- Provide user with results file path

**Results file includes:**

- Header with metadata
- Summary statistics
- Results by category (table format)
- Failed items priority section
- Recommendations
- Timestamp and audit trail

## Output Format

Results file structure:

```markdown
# Checklist Results: {{checklist-name}}

**Subject**: {{subject_name}}
**Date**: {{timestamp}}
**Checklist**: {{checklist_path}}
**Context**: {{context_notes}}

## Summary

- **Total Items**: 25
- **Passed**: 20 (80%)
- **Failed**: 3 (12%)
- **N/A**: 2 (8%)
- **Completion**: 87% (20/23 applicable items passed)
- **Overall Status**: PASS WITH CONCERNS

## Results by Category

### [Category Name]

| Status  | Item                     | Evidence/Notes                                     |

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Technical Review

```
Agent: technical-reviewer
Task: execute-checklist
Inputs:
  - checklist_path: checklists/technical-accuracy-checklist.md
  - subject_name: Chapter 5: Advanced SQL Queries
  - context_notes: Second draft after initial review
Output: reviews/checklist-results/technical-accuracy-checklist-2024-10-24-14-30.md
```

### Example 2: Code Quality Check

```
Agent: code-curator
Task: execute-checklist
Inputs:
  - checklist_path: checklists/code-quality-checklist.md
  - subject_name: Chapter 3: Web Scraping Project
  - context_notes: Final review before publication
Output: reviews/checklist-results/code-quality-checklist-2024-10-24-15-45.md
```

### Example 3: Publisher Submission

```
Agent: publishing-coordinator
Task: execute-checklist
Inputs:
  - checklist_path: checklists/packtpub-submission-checklist.md
  - subject_name: Complete manuscript - Python Web Scraping Book
  - context_notes: Pre-submission quality gate
Output: reviews/checklist-results/packtpub-submission-checklist-2024-10-24-16-20.md
```

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Checklist file not found

- Verify file path is correct relative to project root
- Check file extension is `.md`
- Ensure file exists in expected location

**Issue**: No checklist items detected

- Verify checklist uses standard markdown checkbox format: `- [ ] Item text`
- Check for proper category headings (H2: `## Category Name`)
- Ensure file is not empty or malformed

**Issue**: Unclear how to evaluate item

- Read item carefully and interpret based on context
- Refer to subject material being reviewed
- If truly ambiguous, mark as N/A and note ambiguity in evidence
- Consider consulting checklist owner or subject matter expert

**Issue**: Too many failures to track

- Continue execution, document all failures
- Use Failed Items Priority Section to organize
- Consider if subject needs major rework before continuing
- May indicate checklist mismatch with subject maturity

**Issue**: Results directory doesn't exist

- Create `reviews/checklist-results/` directory structure
- Ensure write permissions
- Verify project root location

## Integration with Workflows

This task is used in quality gates across workflows:

- **Section Development Workflow**: Technical review checkpoint
- **Chapter Assembly Workflow**: Completeness validation
- **Book Planning Workflow**: Proposal and outline validation
- **Publishing Workflows**: Publisher-specific submission requirements
- **Code Repository Workflow**: Code quality validation

## Next Steps

After checklist execution:

1. **If PASS**: Proceed to next workflow step
2. **If PASS WITH CONCERNS**: Review failed items, decide on remediation
3. **If FAIL**: Address failures before proceeding
4. **If CRITICAL FAILURE**: Stop all work, escalate issue

The results file provides an auditable record for:

- Workflow progression decisions
- Quality assurance tracking
- Team communication
- Process improvement analysis

    filename: "chapter-{{chapter_number}}-introduction.md"

workflow:
  elicitation: false
  allow_skip: false
sections:
  - id: hook
    title: Opening Hook
    instruction: |
      Compelling opening (1-2 paragraphs):
      - Real-world scenario or problem
      - Relatable pain point or challenge
      - Intriguing question or statement
      - Story or anecdote

      **Purpose:** Grab reader attention immediately and make them want to keep reading.

      **Examples:**
      - "Have you ever deployed code to production only to watch your application crash under real user load? You're not alone..."
      - "In 2023, a misconfigured authentication system exposed 100 million user records. This chapter teaches you how to avoid becoming the next headline..."
      - "What if you could reduce your API response time from 2 seconds to 200 milliseconds? In this chapter, you'll learn exactly how..."

      The hook should connect to reader pain points or aspirations.
  - id: context
    title: Context and Importance
    instruction: |
      Why this chapter matters (1-2 paragraphs):
      - Industry relevance
      - Common use cases
      - Skills gap this addresses
      - How it fits in the bigger picture
      - Connection to previous chapters

      Help readers understand the "why" before diving into the "how".

      Example:
      "Authentication is the foundation of application security. According to OWASP, broken authentication is consistently one of the top 10 security risks. Yet many developers rely on outdated or insecure patterns. This chapter introduces modern authentication using JWTs and OAuth2, the current industry standard for securing APIs."
  - id: overview
    title: Chapter Overview
    instruction: |
      What this chapter covers (3-5 sentences):
      - Main topics in order
      - High-level learning path
      - Key concepts introduced
      - Practical outcomes

      Give readers a roadmap without overwhelming detail.

      Example:
      "This chapter begins with authentication fundamentals, then walks you through implementing JWT-based authentication in a Flask API. You'll create user registration and login endpoints, secure routes with token validation, and implement refresh token rotation. By the end, you'll have a production-ready authentication system."
  - id: learning_objectives
    title: Learning Objectives
    instruction: |
      What you'll be able to do (4-6 objectives):
      - Use action verbs (implement, analyze, create, design, debug)
      - Be specific and measurable
      - Align with Bloom's taxonomy
      - Focus on skills, not just knowledge

      Format as bullet list starting with "By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:"

      **Examples:**
      - Implement JWT authentication in a REST API
      - Validate and decode JWT tokens securely
      - Design a refresh token rotation strategy
      - Identify and prevent common authentication vulnerabilities
      - Create middleware for protecting API routes
      - Test authentication flows with integration tests

      These set clear expectations for what readers will achieve.
  - id: prerequisites
    title: Prerequisites
    instruction: |
      What readers need to know (bullet list):
      - Previous chapters to complete
      - Assumed knowledge or skills
      - Software versions required
      - Estimated time for chapter completion

      **Examples:**

      - Basic understanding of HTTP headers and status codes
      - Python 3.11+ installed
      - PostgreSQL 15+ running (or Docker installed)
      - Estimated reading time: 45-60 minutes
      - Hands-on exercises: 2-3 hours

      Be honest about prerequisites - frustration from missing knowledge hurts learning.
  - id: what_youll_build
    title: What You'll Build
    instruction: |
      Concrete deliverable or outcome (1-2 paragraphs):
      - Specific project, feature, or system
      - End state description
      - Practical application
      - Connection to real-world usage

      Make the outcome tangible and motivating.

      Example:
      "In this chapter's tutorial, you'll build a complete user authentication system for a task management API. The system includes user registration with password hashing, secure login with JWT tokens, protected routes accessible only to authenticated users, and automatic token refresh for seamless user experience. By the chapter's end, you'll have a working authentication system you can adapt for your own projects."
  - id: time_estimate
    title: Time Estimate
    instruction: |
      How long this chapter takes:
      - Reading time: [minutes]
      - Tutorial/hands-on time: [hours]
      - Exercise completion time: [hours]
      - Total time commitment: [hours]

## General Publisher Considerations

### Royalty Structures

- Traditional publishers: 8-15% of net (after retailer cut)
- Self-publishing: 35-70% of gross (varies by platform)
- Advance payments vary widely (technical books: $5K-$25K typical, can be much higher for established authors)

### Rights and Licensing

- Traditional: publisher typically gets exclusive rights for term
- Self-publishing: you retain all rights
- Code licensing: often separate from book copyright
- Translation rights negotiable

### Marketing and Promotion

- Traditional publisher provides some marketing, author expected to promote
- Self-publishing: 100% author responsibility
- Author platform important for both (blog, social media, speaking)
- Technical community engagement valuable

### Timeline Considerations

- Traditional: 6-18 months from contract to publication
- Self-publishing: author controls timeline (can publish immediately or over time)
- Both: writing typically takes 6-12 months for comprehensive book

---

## Choosing the Right Publisher

### Traditional Publisher When:

- You want professional editing and production
- Marketing support desired
- Credibility and imprint important

### Self-Publishing When:

- You want full control
- Higher per-book royalty important
- Quick time to market needed
- You have existing audience/platform
- You want to retain all rights
- Willing to handle production and marketing

### Hybrid Approach:

- Self-publish first to build audience
- Traditional deal for expanded/updated version
- Or reverse: traditional first, then self-publish later editions
- Different books with different publishers
