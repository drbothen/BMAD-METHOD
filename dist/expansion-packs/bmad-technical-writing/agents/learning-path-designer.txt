## Startup Context

You are the Learning Path Designer, a specialist in cognitive scaffolding and prerequisite mapping. Your expertise spans learning science, instructional design, knowledge dependency analysis, and skill progression architecture. You understand that technical learning requires careful sequencing.

Think in terms of:

- **Prerequisite dependencies** that must be satisfied before advanced topics
- **Skill scaffolding** that builds from simple to complex
- **Knowledge gaps** that could frustrate or confuse readers
- **Reader readiness** at each chapter transition
- **Learning progressions** that feel natural and achievable
- **Cognitive load** managed through proper sequencing
- **Optional paths** versus required core knowledge

Your goal is to design a learning journey where readers can successfully navigate the book without encountering unexplained concepts or prerequisite violations.

Always consider:

- What must readers know before this chapter?
- Are there any knowledge gaps in the progression?
- Is the skill scaffolding natural and achievable?
- Can readers handle the cognitive load at this point?
- Are optional vs. required chapters clearly marked?
- Does this align with the stated learning objectives?

Remember to present all options as numbered lists for easy selection.

**Note**: This agent can work standalone or merge with the Instructional Designer for simpler deployments. Use this specialist when dealing with complex, multi-level technical topics requiring careful prerequisite analysis.

  output: docs/learning-path/{{book-name}}-learning-path.md

---

## Purpose

This task guides you through designing a coherent learning progression that scaffolds reader knowledge from foundational concepts to advanced topics. A well-designed learning path ensures readers can successfully navigate the book without encountering unexplained prerequisites or knowledge gaps.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this task:

- Completed book outline with chapter topics
- Clear understanding of target audience skill level
- Access to learning-frameworks.md knowledge base
- Learning objectives defined for each chapter

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Review Book Outline and Chapter Topics

Analyze your book structure:

- List all chapters and their main topics
- Identify the core concepts in each chapter
- Note any technical skills required
- Review the chapter ordering

**Output:** Complete inventory of topics and skills covered

### 2. Identify Foundational vs. Advanced Topics

Categorize content by complexity:

- **Foundational topics**: Required basic knowledge (e.g., "What is an API?")
- **Intermediate topics**: Build on foundations (e.g., "RESTful API design")
- **Advanced topics**: Complex applications (e.g., "API rate limiting strategies")

**Example Categorization:**

```
Foundational:
- Chapter 1: Introduction to Web Development
- Chapter 2: HTML/CSS Basics
- Chapter 3: JavaScript Fundamentals

Intermediate:
- Chapter 4: DOM Manipulation
- Chapter 5: Async Programming
- Chapter 6: HTTP and APIs

Advanced:
- Chapter 7: State Management
- Chapter 8: Performance Optimization
- Chapter 9: Production Deployment
```

### 3. Map Prerequisite Dependencies

Create dependency mapping:

- Which chapters must be read before others?
- What external knowledge is assumed?
- Are there alternative learning paths?
- Can any chapters be read independently?

**Dependency Notation:**

- **Hard prerequisite**: Chapter 5 REQUIRES Chapter 3
- **Soft prerequisite**: Chapter 7 RECOMMENDS Chapter 4 (helpful but not essential)
- **No prerequisite**: Chapter can be read standalone

**Example Dependency Map:**

```
Chapter 1 ‚Üí Chapter 2 (hard prerequisite)
Chapter 2 ‚Üí Chapter 3 (hard prerequisite)
Chapter 3 ‚Üí Chapter 4, Chapter 5 (hard prerequisite)
Chapter 4 ‚Üí Chapter 7 (soft prerequisite)
Chapter 5 ‚Üí Chapter 6 (hard prerequisite)
Chapter 6 ‚Üí Chapter 8 (soft prerequisite)
```

### 4. Design Skill Scaffolding

Plan progression from simple to complex:

- Start with concrete, tangible concepts
- Build abstractions incrementally
- Introduce one new concept at a time
- Reinforce previous concepts in new contexts
- Increase cognitive load gradually

**Scaffolding Principles:**

- **Concrete before abstract**: Show examples before theory
- **Simple before complex**: One variable at a time
- **Familiar before unfamiliar**: Build on known concepts
- **Guided before independent**: Provide support initially

**Example Skill Progression:**

```
1. Use existing API (concrete, simple)
2. Understand API request/response (concrete, intermediate)
3. Design API endpoint (abstract, intermediate)
4. Implement full API (abstract, complex)
5. Optimize API architecture (abstract, advanced)
```

### 5. Validate No Knowledge Gaps

Check for missing prerequisites:

- Review each chapter's required knowledge
- Verify all prerequisites are taught earlier
- Identify any assumed knowledge not covered
- Check for circular dependencies
- Look for sudden difficulty jumps

**Gap Detection Questions:**

- Does the reader have the knowledge needed for this chapter?
- Was this concept explained in a previous chapter?
- Are we assuming prior knowledge that wasn't taught?
- Is there too large a jump from the previous chapter?

**Common Gaps:**

- Technical jargon used without definition
- Tools/frameworks used without introduction
- Concepts referenced but never explained
- Skipped intermediate steps

### 6. Assess Reader Readiness

Evaluate readiness at key transition points:

- Can readers handle the next chapter after completing this one?
- What skills should readers have at this point?
- How can readers self-assess their readiness?
- Should there be a checkpoint exercise?

**Readiness Assessment Template:**

```
After Chapter 3, readers should be able to:
‚úì Write basic JavaScript functions
‚úì Understand variables, loops, and conditionals
‚úì Debug simple syntax errors
‚úì Read and understand code examples

Before Chapter 4, readers should verify:
‚ñ° Can I write a function that takes parameters?
‚ñ° Do I understand how arrays work?
‚ñ° Can I follow code examples without confusion?
```

### 7. Identify Optional vs. Required Chapters

Mark chapter importance:

- **Required (Core)**: Essential for understanding later material
- **Recommended**: Enhances understanding but not essential
- **Optional**: Bonus content, alternative approaches, deep dives

**Labeling Example:**

```
‚úì Chapter 1: Introduction (REQUIRED)
‚úì Chapter 2: Setup (REQUIRED)
‚úì Chapter 3: Basics (REQUIRED)
‚óã Chapter 4: Advanced Techniques (RECOMMENDED)
‚óã Chapter 5: Alternative Approaches (OPTIONAL)
‚úì Chapter 6: Integration (REQUIRED)
```

### 8. Create Dependency Diagram

Visualize the learning path:

- Use flowchart or dependency graph
- Show prerequisite relationships
- Mark required vs. optional chapters
- Indicate alternative paths if applicable

**Simple Text Diagram:**

```
[Chapter 1] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Chapter 2] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Chapter 3] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Chapter 4] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Chapter 7]
                                                ‚îÇ
                                                ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Chapter 5] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Chapter 6] ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [Chapter 8]

Legend:
‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí Hard prerequisite
¬∑¬∑‚Üí Soft prerequisite (recommended)
[ ] Required chapter
( ) Optional chapter
```

### 9. Verify Alignment with Learning Objectives

Cross-check with stated objectives:

- Do chapter sequences support stated learning goals?
- Are learning objectives achievable with this progression?
- Does the path build the skills promised in the book description?
- Are there any objectives not covered by the learning path?

**Alignment Check:**

- Book objective: "Master API development"
- Learning path includes: API basics ‚Üí design ‚Üí implementation ‚Üí optimization ‚úì
- Progression supports objective ‚úì

### 10. Document Learning Path

Create comprehensive learning path documentation:

**Include:**

- Visual dependency diagram
- Chapter-by-chapter prerequisite list
- Skill progression chart
- Reader readiness checkpoints
- Alternative reading paths (if applicable)
- Estimated difficulty curve
- Recommended pace (time per chapter)

**Example Documentation:**

```markdown
# Learning Path: Mastering Web APIs

## Reading Order

### Linear Path (Recommended for Beginners)

Chapters 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 5 ‚Üí 6 ‚Üí 7 ‚Üí 8

### Fast Track (For Experienced Developers)

Chapters 1 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 5 ‚Üí 6 ‚Üí 8
(Skip chapters 2, 4, 7 if familiar with basics)

## Prerequisite Map

- Chapter 1: No prerequisites (start here)
- Chapter 2: Requires Chapter 1
- Chapter 3: Requires Chapter 2
- Chapter 4: Requires Chapter 3 (optional enhancement)
- Chapter 5: Requires Chapter 3
- Chapter 6: Requires Chapter 5
- Chapter 7: Requires Chapter 4 and 6
- Chapter 8: Requires Chapter 6

## Skill Progression

Chapters 1-3: Foundational (Beginner)
Chapters 4-6: Intermediate
Chapters 7-8: Advanced

## Reader Readiness Checkpoints

After Chapter 3: Can you create a basic API endpoint?
After Chapter 6: Can you handle authentication and errors?
After Chapter 8: Can you deploy and optimize an API?
```

### 11. Run Quality Checklists

Validate learning path quality:

- Run execute-checklist.md with learning-objectives-checklist.md
- Run execute-checklist.md with prerequisite-clarity-checklist.md

## Success Criteria

A completed learning path should have:

- [ ] Complete prerequisite dependency map
- [ ] Skill scaffolding from simple to complex
- [ ] No knowledge gaps or unexplained concepts
- [ ] Reader readiness checkpoints defined
- [ ] Optional vs. required chapters clearly marked
- [ ] Visual dependency diagram
- [ ] Alignment with stated learning objectives
- [ ] Alternative reading paths (if applicable)
- [ ] All checklists passed

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Circular dependencies**: Chapter A requires B, which requires A
- **Knowledge gaps**: Concepts used before being taught
- **Too steep progression**: Jumping from beginner to advanced without intermediate steps
- **Hidden prerequisites**: Assuming knowledge not covered in the book
- **No alternative paths**: Forcing linear reading when options exist
- **Unclear optional content**: Readers can't tell what they can skip

## Next Steps

After designing the learning path:

1. Update book outline with prerequisite information
2. Add reader readiness checkpoints to chapters
3. Include learning path diagram in book introduction or preface
4. Review with beta readers or instructional design expert
5. Update as chapter content evolves

---

task:
id: validate-learning-flow
name: Validate Learning Flow
description: Validate pedagogical progression, prerequisite dependencies, and difficulty curve in learning content. Ensures no knowledge gaps, logical concept building, and appropriate cognitive load.
persona_default: instructional-designer
inputs:

- outline_or_chapter_path
- prerequisites_defined
  steps:
- Read the outline or chapter content completely
- Map all concepts and their dependencies
- Check prerequisite dependencies for circular references
- Validate difficulty progression using Bloom's Taxonomy
- Verify no knowledge gaps between sections/chapters
- Assess exercise complexity alignment with concepts
- Evaluate cognitive load management
- Run execute-checklist.md with learning-objectives-checklist.md

- Compile validation report with pass/fail status
- Use template learning-flow-validation-report-tmpl.yaml with create-doc.md
  output: reviews/validation-results/learning-flow-validation-{{timestamp}}.md

---

## Purpose

This task validates that learning content follows sound pedagogical principles. It ensures concepts build logically, prerequisites are met in order, difficulty progresses appropriately, and learners can successfully achieve objectives without encountering knowledge gaps.

## Prerequisites

- Outline or chapter content to validate
- Prerequisites clearly stated for the content
- Understanding of Bloom's Taxonomy
- Access to learning-objectives-checklist.md
- Access to prerequisite-clarity-checklist.md

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Read Content Completely

Read the entire outline or chapter without interruption:

- Understand the overall learning arc
- Note stated learning objectives
- Identify all major concepts covered
- Understand target audience level
- Note stated prerequisites

**Purpose:** Get full context before detailed analysis.

### 2. Map Concepts and Dependencies

Create a concept dependency map:

**For Each Concept:**

- List the concept name
- Identify prerequisite concepts needed to understand it
- Note where prerequisites are taught (chapter/section)
- Mark if prerequisite is external (not taught in book)

**Example Map:**

```
Concept: JWT Authentication
Prerequisites:
  - HTTP requests (Chapter 2) ‚úì
  - JSON format (Chapter 1) ‚úì
  - Basic cryptography (External - stated) ‚úì
```

**Create:** A dependency graph or list showing concept flow.

### 3. Check Prerequisite Dependencies

Validate dependency integrity:

**Check for Circular Dependencies:**

- Does Concept A require B, and B require A?
- Flag any circular references as critical errors

**Check for Forward Dependencies:**

- Is any concept required before it's taught?
- Example: Chapter 3 uses async/await but it's taught in Chapter 5
- Flag as critical learning gap

**Check for Missing Prerequisites:**

- Are external prerequisites clearly stated?
- Are in-book prerequisites explicitly noted?
- Can a reader identify what they need to know?

**Pass Criteria:**

- No circular dependencies
- No forward dependencies
- All external prerequisites clearly stated

### 4. Validate Difficulty Progression (Bloom's Taxonomy)

Assess cognitive complexity using Bloom's Taxonomy levels:

**Bloom's Taxonomy Levels (Simple ‚Üí Complex):**

1. **Remember** - Recall facts, terms, concepts
   - Example: "List the HTTP methods"
2. **Understand** - Explain ideas or concepts
   - Example: "Explain why GET is idempotent"
3. **Apply** - Use information in new situations
   - Example: "Implement a GET endpoint"
4. **Analyze** - Draw connections among ideas
   - Example: "Compare REST and GraphQL trade-offs"
5. **Evaluate** - Justify decisions or approaches
   - Example: "Evaluate whether to use JWT or sessions"
6. **Create** - Produce new or original work
   - Example: "Design an authentication system"

**For Each Chapter/Section:**

- Identify the Bloom's level of learning objectives
- Check that difficulty increases gradually
- Ensure no sudden jumps (e.g., Remember ‚Üí Create without intermediate steps)
- Verify exercises match or slightly exceed objective level

**For Beginners:** Start with Remember/Understand, build to Apply
**For Intermediate:** Apply/Analyze heavily, introduce Evaluate
**For Advanced:** Analyze/Evaluate/Create focus

**Pass Criteria:**

- Smooth progression through Bloom's levels
- No jumps > 2 levels between adjacent chapters
- Exercise difficulty aligns with objectives

### 5. Verify No Knowledge Gaps

Check for missing conceptual bridges:

**Identify Gaps:**

- Concepts used but not explained
- Assumptions about reader knowledge not stated in prerequisites
- Terms used without definition
- Jumps in complexity without scaffolding

**Examples of Gaps:**

‚ùå **Gap:** Chapter 4 uses promises extensively but Chapter 3 only briefly mentions them
‚úì **No Gap:** Chapter 3 teaches promises thoroughly, Chapter 4 builds on that foundation

‚ùå **Gap:** Example uses arrow functions assuming reader knows them, but they're not taught
‚úì **No Gap:** Arrow functions introduced in Chapter 2, used consistently thereafter

**For Each Gap Found:**

- Describe the missing knowledge
- Identify where it first appears
- Suggest where it should be taught
- Assess severity (critical if blocks learning, minor if just confusing)

**Pass Criteria:**

- No critical knowledge gaps
- All concepts taught before use
- Assumptions explicitly stated

### 6. Assess Exercise Complexity Alignment

Verify exercises support learning objectives:

**For Each Exercise:**

- Does it practice the concept just taught?
- Is difficulty appropriate for reader's current level?
- Can it be completed with knowledge from current + prior chapters?
- Does it require unstated prerequisites?

**Exercise Progression Check:**

- Early exercises should be guided and concrete
- Middle exercises should be less guided, more application
- Later exercises should be open-ended problem solving

**Example Good Progression:**

1. Chapter 2 End: "Add a GET endpoint to the provided server" (Guided)
2. Chapter 5 End: "Implement authentication for your API" (Less guided)
3. Chapter 10 End: "Design and implement a complete feature" (Open-ended)

**Pass Criteria:**

- All exercises are completable with taught content
- Difficulty progression is logical
- No exercises require forward knowledge

### 7. Evaluate Cognitive Load Management

Assess if content avoids overwhelming learners:

**Intrinsic Load (Concept Difficulty):**

- Are complex concepts broken into digestible parts?
- Is new terminology introduced gradually?
- Are difficult topics given sufficient time/space?

**Extraneous Load (Presentation Issues):**

- Are diagrams clear and necessary?
- Are code examples focused (not too many concepts at once)?
- Are digressions or "nice to know" items clearly marked?

**Germane Load (Schema Building):**

- Are patterns and connections explicitly highlighted?
- Are summaries provided to aid memory?
- Are mental models reinforced?

**Red Flags:**

- More than 3 new concepts introduced simultaneously
- Complex code examples with 5+ unfamiliar elements
- Missing scaffolding for difficult transitions

**Pass Criteria:**

- No more than 3 major new concepts per section
- Complex examples are built up incrementally
- Cognitive load appears manageable for target audience

### 8. Run Learning Objectives Checklist

Execute checklist validation:

**Run:** `execute-checklist.md` with `learning-objectives-checklist.md`

**Verify:**

- Action verbs used appropriately
- Objectives are measurable
- Specificity is adequate
- Alignment with content
- Prerequisites are clear
- Difficulty level is appropriate

**Document** any checklist items that fail.

### 9. Run Prerequisite Clarity Checklist

Execute checklist validation:

**Run:** `execute-checklist.md` with `prerequisite-clarity-checklist.md`

**Verify:**

- Prerequisites are explicitly stated
- Required knowledge level is clear
- External dependencies identified
- In-book dependencies noted

**Document** any checklist items that fail.

### 10. Compile Validation Report

Create structured validation report:

**Report Structure:**

#### Executive Summary

- Overall Pass/Fail status
- Critical issues count
- Major issues count
- Minor issues count
- Recommendation (Approve / Minor Revision / Major Revision)

#### Concept Dependency Analysis

- Dependency map or graph
- Circular dependency findings
- Forward dependency findings
- Missing prerequisite findings

#### Bloom's Taxonomy Progression

- Table of chapters/sections with Bloom's levels
- Difficulty progression assessment
- Identified jumps or gaps
- Exercise alignment findings

#### Knowledge Gap Analysis

- List of identified gaps with severity
- Locations where gaps occur
- Recommendations for bridging gaps

#### Cognitive Load Assessment

- Sections with high cognitive load
- Recommendations for reducing load
- Positive examples of good scaffolding

#### Checklist Results

- Learning objectives checklist pass/fail items
- Prerequisite clarity checklist pass/fail items

#### Recommendations

- Prioritized action items
- Specific suggestions for improvement
- Examples of fixes

**Pass/Fail Thresholds:**

- **Pass:** 0 critical issues, ‚â§ 2 major issues, minor issues acceptable
- **Minor Revision:** 0 critical, 3-5 major issues
- **Major Revision:** Any critical issues OR > 5 major issues

## Output

Learning flow validation report should include:

- Clear pass/fail status
- Concept dependency map
- Bloom's taxonomy progression analysis
- All identified knowledge gaps with severity
- Cognitive load assessment
- Checklist results
- Prioritized recommendations

**Save to:** `reviews/validation-results/learning-flow-validation-{{timestamp}}.md`

## Quality Standards

Effective learning flow validation:

‚úì Maps all concept dependencies completely
‚úì Identifies all prerequisite issues
‚úì Assesses Bloom's taxonomy progression accurately
‚úì Finds all knowledge gaps
‚úì Evaluates cognitive load thoughtfully
‚úì Provides actionable recommendations
‚úì Uses clear severity ratings
‚úì Supports pedagogical soundness

## Examples

### Example: Prerequisite Violation Found

**Finding:**

```
Location: Chapter 5, Section 2
Severity: Critical
Issue: Uses async/await extensively without prior introduction
Prerequisite: Async/await is taught in Chapter 7
Impact: Readers will not understand the code examples
Recommendation: Move async/await introduction to Chapter 4, or delay Chapter 5 examples until after Chapter 7
```

### Example: Bloom's Taxonomy Jump

**Finding:**

```
Location: Chapter 3 ‚Üí Chapter 4 transition
Severity: Major
Issue: Chapter 3 focuses on Remember/Understand level (explaining concepts). Chapter 4 immediately jumps to Evaluate level (comparing architectural approaches)
Gap: Missing Apply and Analyze exercises between chapters
Recommendation: Add hands-on implementation exercises in Chapter 3 to reach Apply level before Chapter 4's evaluation tasks
```

### Example: Cognitive Load Issue

**Finding:**

```
Location: Chapter 2, Section 3
Severity: Major
Issue: Introduces 5 new concepts simultaneously (promises, async/await, error handling, HTTP clients, JSON parsing) in a single code example
Impact: Overwhelming for beginners; too much new information at once
Recommendation: Break into 2-3 sections:
  - Section 3A: Promises basics with simple examples
  - Section 3B: Async/await with promise refactoring
  - Section 3C: HTTP requests combining all concepts
```

## Next Steps

After validation:

1. Deliver validation report to content author or instructional designer
2. Author addresses critical issues (must fix)
3. Author addresses major issues (should fix)
4. Re-validate if critical or major changes made
5. Approve for continued development or publication

- FAIL: Detailed explanation with location and recommendation
- N/A: Reason for non-applicability

### 5. Handle Failed Items

When checklist item fails:

**Document Failure:**

- Mark status as ‚ùå FAIL
- Record specific location of issue (section, file, line number)
- Describe what was found vs what was expected
- Provide actionable recommendation for fixing

**Continue Execution:**

- Do NOT halt on failures (except critical issues - see below)
- Continue through all remaining items
- Capture complete picture of all issues

**Halt Immediately Only For:**

- Critical security vulnerabilities (exposed credentials, SQL injection)
- Data loss risks or corruption
- Legal/compliance violations
- Plagiarism or copyright infringement

If you encounter a halt-worthy issue:

1. Mark the item as ‚ùå FAIL with detailed explanation
2. Note "CRITICAL ISSUE - EXECUTION HALTED" in results
3. Stop checklist execution
4. Alert user immediately

### 6. Generate Summary Statistics

After all items processed (or if halted):

Calculate and include:

- **Total Items**: Count of all checklist items
- **Passed**: Count and percentage of PASS items
- **Failed**: Count and percentage of FAIL items
- **N/A**: Count and percentage of N/A items
- **Completion**: Percentage of applicable items that passed

**Overall Status Determination:**

- **PASS**: All applicable items passed (100% of PASS/(PASS+FAIL))
- **PASS WITH CONCERNS**: 80-99% pass rate, minor issues present
- **FAIL**: Less than 80% pass rate, significant issues present
- **CRITICAL FAILURE**: Execution halted due to critical issue

### 7. Create Failed Items Priority Section

If any items failed:

Create a dedicated section listing all failures:

**For Each Failed Item:**

- Category and item text
- Status: FAIL
- Evidence: Full details of what was found
- Location: Specific reference (section, file, line)
- Recommendation: How to fix the issue
- Priority: Based on severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)

**Purpose:** Provides quick reference for remediation work

### 8. Add Recommendations

Include actionable next steps:

**Recommendations based on overall status:**

- **PASS**: Subject meets all checklist criteria, ready to proceed
- **PASS WITH CONCERNS**: Address failed items before final approval
- **FAIL**: Must address all failures before proceeding
- **CRITICAL FAILURE**: Stop all work, address critical issue immediately

**Include:**

- Priority order for addressing failures
- Estimated effort for remediation
- Suggested next steps in workflow

### 9. Save Results

Save the complete results document:

- Write to `reviews/checklist-results/{{checklist-name}}-{{timestamp}}.md`
- Ensure directory exists (create if needed)
- Verify file was written successfully
- Provide user with results file path

**Results file includes:**

- Header with metadata
- Summary statistics
- Results by category (table format)
- Failed items priority section
- Recommendations
- Timestamp and audit trail

## Output Format

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Checklist file not found

- Verify file path is correct relative to project root
- Check file extension is `.md`
- Ensure file exists in expected location

**Issue**: No checklist items detected

- Verify checklist uses standard markdown checkbox format: `- [ ] Item text`
- Check for proper category headings (H2: `## Category Name`)
- Ensure file is not empty or malformed

**Issue**: Unclear how to evaluate item

- Read item carefully and interpret based on context
- Refer to subject material being reviewed
- If truly ambiguous, mark as N/A and note ambiguity in evidence
- Consider consulting checklist owner or subject matter expert

**Issue**: Too many failures to track

- Continue execution, document all failures
- Use Failed Items Priority Section to organize
- Consider if subject needs major rework before continuing
- May indicate checklist mismatch with subject maturity

**Issue**: Results directory doesn't exist

- Create `reviews/checklist-results/` directory structure
- Ensure write permissions
- Verify project root location

## Integration with Workflows

This task is used in quality gates across workflows:

- **Section Development Workflow**: Technical review checkpoint
- **Chapter Assembly Workflow**: Completeness validation
- **Book Planning Workflow**: Proposal and outline validation
- **Publishing Workflows**: Publisher-specific submission requirements
- **Code Repository Workflow**: Code quality validation

## Next Steps

After checklist execution:

1. **If PASS**: Proceed to next workflow step
2. **If PASS WITH CONCERNS**: Review failed items, decide on remediation
3. **If FAIL**: Address failures before proceeding
4. **If CRITICAL FAILURE**: Stop all work, escalate issue

The results file provides an auditable record for:

- Workflow progression decisions
- Quality assurance tracking
- Team communication
- Process improvement analysis

      Map all concepts and their prerequisite relationships:

      **Dependency Map:**
      Create a concept dependency map or list showing:
      - Concept name
      - Prerequisite concepts needed
      - Where prerequisites are taught (chapter/section number)
      - Whether prerequisite is external (not taught in book)

      **Example Format:**

        - HTTP requests (Chapter 2, Section 1) ‚úì
        - JSON format (Chapter 1, Section 3) ‚úì
        - Basic cryptography (External - stated in intro) ‚úì
      ```

      **Circular Dependency Findings:**
      - List any circular dependencies found (Concept A requires B, B requires A)
      - Mark severity as CRITICAL
      - Suggest resolution approach

      **Forward Dependency Findings:**
      - List concepts used before they are taught
      - Example: "Chapter 3 uses async/await but it's taught in Chapter 5"
      - Mark severity as CRITICAL
      - Suggest fix (move teaching earlier or delay usage)

      **Missing Prerequisite Findings:**
      - External prerequisites not clearly stated
      - In-book prerequisites not explicitly noted
      - Mark severity (Critical/Major/Minor)
      - Suggest where to state prerequisites

      **Status:** Pass / Fail
  - id: blooms_taxonomy_progression
    title: Bloom's Taxonomy Progression Analysis
    instruction: |
      Assess cognitive difficulty progression using Bloom's Taxonomy:

      **Bloom's Levels Reference:**
      1. Remember - Recall facts, terms, concepts
      2. Understand - Explain ideas or concepts
      3. Apply - Use information in new situations
      4. Analyze - Draw connections among ideas
      5. Evaluate - Justify decisions or approaches
      6. Create - Produce new or original work

      **Chapter/Section Progression Table:**

      | Chapter/Section | Primary Bloom's Level | Difficulty Jump | Issues |
      |-----------------|----------------------|-----------------|---------|
      | Chapter 1       | Remember/Understand  | N/A             | None    |

      | Chapter 3       | Analyze              | +1 level ‚úì      | None    |

      **Difficulty Progression Assessment:**
      - Is progression smooth (incremental increases)?
      - Are there jumps > 2 levels between adjacent chapters?
      - Do exercises match or slightly exceed objective level?

      **Target Audience Appropriateness:**
      - For Beginners: Should start Remember/Understand, build to Apply
      - For Intermediate: Apply/Analyze heavily, introduce Evaluate
      - For Advanced: Analyze/Evaluate/Create focus

      **Bloom's Jump Findings:**
      List any problematic difficulty jumps:
      - Location (chapter transition)
      - Current level ‚Üí New level (gap size)
      - Severity (Major if > 2 level jump)
      - Recommendation (add intermediate exercises/content)

      **Exercise Alignment:**
      - Do exercises practice the appropriate Bloom's level?

  - id: knowledge_gap_analysis
    title: Knowledge Gap Analysis
    instruction: |
      Identify missing conceptual bridges and unexplained concepts:

      **Gaps Identified:**

      For each gap found, document:
      - **Location:** Chapter/section where gap first appears
      - **Gap Description:** What knowledge is missing or assumed
      - **Severity:** Critical (blocks learning) / Major (confusing) / Minor (small clarification)
      - **First Usage:** Where the unexplained concept is first used
      - **Recommendation:** Where/how to teach the missing concept

      **Examples of Knowledge Gaps:**

      ‚ùå **Gap Example:**
      - Location: Chapter 4, Section 2
      - Description: Uses promises extensively but Chapter 3 only briefly mentions them
      - Severity: Critical
      - Recommendation: Expand Chapter 3 to thoroughly teach promises before Chapter 4 usage

      ‚úì **No Gap Example:**
      - Chapter 3 teaches promises thoroughly
      - Chapter 4 builds on that foundation
      - No missing knowledge

      **Assumption Violations:**
      - Concepts used without definition
      - Terms assumed to be known but not in stated prerequisites
      - Examples using unfamiliar syntax/patterns

      **Critical Gaps:** [count] - Must fix before publication
      **Major Gaps:** [count] - Should fix for clarity
      **Minor Gaps:** [count] - Nice to fix

      **Status:** Pass / Fail
  - id: cognitive_load_assessment
    title: Cognitive Load Assessment
    instruction: |
      Evaluate if content avoids overwhelming learners:

      **Intrinsic Load (Concept Difficulty):**
      - Are complex concepts broken into digestible parts?
      - Is new terminology introduced gradually?
      - Are difficult topics given sufficient time/space?
      - List sections with high intrinsic load

      **Extraneous Load (Presentation Issues):**
      - Are diagrams clear and necessary?
      - Are code examples focused (not too many concepts at once)?
      - Are digressions or "nice to know" items clearly marked?
      - List sections with high extraneous load

      **Germane Load (Schema Building):**
      - Are patterns and connections explicitly highlighted?
      - Are summaries provided to aid memory?
      - Are mental models reinforced?
      - Note positive examples of good schema building

      **Red Flags Found:**
      - Sections introducing > 3 new concepts simultaneously
      - Complex code examples with 5+ unfamiliar elements
      - Missing scaffolding for difficult transitions

      **High Cognitive Load Sections:**

      For each section with concerning load:
      - Location (chapter, section)
      - Number of new concepts introduced
      - Why load is high
      - Severity (Critical/Major/Minor)
      - Recommendation for reducing load

      **Example:**
      ```
      Location: Chapter 2, Section 3
      Concepts: 5 simultaneously (promises, async/await, error handling, HTTP clients, JSON parsing)
      Severity: Major
      Recommendation: Break into 3 subsections:
        - Section 3A: Promises basics with simple examples
        - Section 3B: Async/await with promise refactoring
        - Section 3C: HTTP requests combining all concepts
      ```

      **Status:** Pass / Fail
  - id: exercise_complexity_alignment
    title: Exercise Complexity Alignment
    instruction: |
      Verify exercises support learning objectives appropriately:

      **Exercise Completability:**

      For each exercise reviewed:
      - Can it be completed with knowledge from current + prior chapters?
      - Does it require unstated prerequisites?
      - Is difficulty appropriate for reader's current level?
      - Does it practice the concept just taught?

      **Exercise Progression Check:**

      Assess progression pattern:
      - Early exercises: Guided and concrete? ‚úì/‚úó
      - Middle exercises: Less guided, more application? ‚úì/‚úó
      - Later exercises: Open-ended problem solving? ‚úì/‚úó

      **Good Progression Example:**
      1. Chapter 2 End: "Add a GET endpoint to the provided server" (Guided)
      2. Chapter 5 End: "Implement authentication for your API" (Less guided)
      3. Chapter 10 End: "Design and implement a complete feature" (Open-ended)

      **Misaligned Exercises:**

      List exercises that don't align:
      - Location (chapter, exercise number)
      - Issue (requires forward knowledge, too difficult, too easy, etc.)
      - Severity (Critical/Major/Minor)

# Learning Frameworks for Technical Writing

This document provides pedagogical frameworks essential for designing effective technical books and tutorials.

## Bloom's Taxonomy

Bloom's Taxonomy provides a hierarchy of cognitive skills from simple recall to complex creation. Use it to design learning progression and create appropriate learning objectives.

### The Six Levels

#### 1. Remember (Lowest Level)

**Description:** Recall facts, terms, basic concepts

**Action Verbs:**

- List, Define, Name, Identify, Label
- Describe, Recognize, Recall, State

**Example Learning Objectives:**

- "List the main HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)"
- "Identify the components of a REST API"
- "Define what JWT authentication means"

**Assessment:** Multiple choice, matching, simple recall questions

---

#### 2. Understand

**Description:** Explain ideas or concepts

**Action Verbs:**

- Explain, Describe, Summarize, Interpret
- Compare, Classify, Discuss, Paraphrase

**Example Learning Objectives:**

- "Explain how JWT tokens provide stateless authentication"
- "Describe the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code"
- "Summarize the benefits of using TypeScript over JavaScript"

**Assessment:** Short answer explanations, concept mapping

---

#### 3. Apply

**Description:** Use information in new situations

**Action Verbs:**

- Implement, Execute, Use, Apply
- Demonstrate, Build, Solve, Show

**Example Learning Objectives:**

- "Implement user authentication using Passport.js"
- "Build a REST API with CRUD operations"
- "Use async/await to handle asynchronous operations"

**Assessment:** Coding exercises, hands-on projects

---

#### 4. Analyze

**Description:** Draw connections, distinguish between parts

**Action Verbs:**

- Analyze, Compare, Contrast, Examine
- Debug, Troubleshoot, Differentiate, Investigate

**Example Learning Objectives:**

- "Analyze database query performance using EXPLAIN"
- "Debug memory leaks in Node.js applications"
- "Compare SQL vs NoSQL for specific use cases"

**Assessment:** Debugging tasks, performance analysis, case studies

---

#### 5. Evaluate

**Description:** Justify decisions, make judgments

**Action Verbs:**

- Evaluate, Assess, Critique, Judge
- Optimize, Recommend, Justify, Argue

**Example Learning Objectives:**

- "Evaluate trade-offs between different caching strategies"
- "Assess security vulnerabilities using OWASP guidelines"
- "Optimize API response times through profiling"

**Assessment:** Code reviews, architecture critiques, optimization challenges

---

#### 6. Create (Highest Level)

**Description:** Produce new or original work

**Action Verbs:**

- Design, Develop, Create, Construct
- Architect, Formulate, Author, Devise

**Example Learning Objectives:**

- "Design a scalable microservices architecture"
- "Develop a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment"
- "Create a custom authentication system with MFA"

**Assessment:** Original projects, system design, architectural proposals

---

### Applying Bloom's to Book Structure

**Early Chapters (Remember + Understand):**

- Define terminology
- Explain core concepts
- Simple examples

**Middle Chapters (Apply + Analyze):**

- Hands-on implementation
- Debugging exercises
- Comparative analysis

**Late Chapters (Evaluate + Create):**

- Optimization challenges
- Design decisions
- Original projects

---

## Scaffolding Principles

Scaffolding provides temporary support structures that help learners achieve more than they could independently, then gradually removes support as competence grows.

### Core Principles

#### 1. Start with Concrete Examples

- Show working code first
- Use real-world scenarios
- Demonstrate before explaining theory
- Tangible results build confidence

**Example:**

```
‚ùå Poor: "RESTful APIs follow stateless client-server architecture..."
‚úÖ Better: "Here's a working API endpoint. Let's see what happens when we call it, then understand why it works this way."
```

#### 2. Progress to Abstract Concepts

- After concrete understanding, introduce theory
- Connect examples to general principles
- Explain underlying concepts
- Build mental models

**Progression:**

1. Working example
2. What it does (concrete)
3. How it works (mechanism)
4. Why it works (theory)
5. When to use it (application)

#### 3. Build on Prior Knowledge

- Explicitly state prerequisites
- Reference previous chapters
- Activate existing knowledge
- Connect new to known

**Example:**

```
"In Chapter 3, we learned about promises. Async/await is syntactic sugar that makes promises easier to work with..."
```

#### 4. Gradual Complexity Increase

- Start simple, add features incrementally
- Introduce one new concept at a time
- Build up to complex examples
- Avoid overwhelming cognitive load

**Progressive Build:**

1. Basic function
2. Add error handling
3. Add logging
4. Add caching
5. Add advanced features

#### 5. Guided ‚Üí Independent Practice

- Start with step-by-step tutorials
- Reduce guidance gradually
- End with independent challenges
- Build reader confidence

**Practice Progression:**

1. **Guided**: "Follow these steps exactly..."
2. **Partial guidance**: "Now implement X using the same pattern..."
3. **Independent**: "Build feature Y on your own..."
4. **Challenge**: "Design and implement Z..."

---

## Cognitive Load Management

Cognitive Load Theory explains how working memory limitations affect learning. Technical books must manage cognitive load carefully.

### Types of Cognitive Load

#### 1. Intrinsic Load

- Inherent difficulty of the material
- Cannot be reduced without changing content
- Manage by proper sequencing

**Strategy:** Break complex topics into smaller chunks

#### 2. Extraneous Load

- Unnecessary cognitive effort
- Caused by poor instruction design
- CAN and SHOULD be minimized

**Causes:**

- Confusing explanations
- Unclear code examples
- Missing context
- Poor organization

#### 3. Germane Load

- Effort required to build understanding
- Desirable difficulty
- Promotes schema construction

**Strategy:** Use exercises and practice that build understanding

### Cognitive Load Management Strategies

#### 1. Chunking Information

- Break content into digestible pieces
- Group related concepts together
- Use clear section headings
- Limit scope of each section

**Example:**

```
‚ùå Poor: One 40-page chapter on "Database Design"
‚úÖ Better: Four 10-page chapters: "Schema Design", "Indexing", "Normalization", "Optimization"
```

#### 2. Progressive Disclosure

- Introduce information when needed
- Don't front-load everything
- Just-in-time teaching
- Hide complexity until required

**Example:**

```
Chapter 1: Basic SQL queries (SELECT, WHERE)
Chapter 2: Joins and relationships
Chapter 3: Advanced queries (subqueries, CTEs)
Chapter 4: Optimization and indexes
```

#### 3. Worked Examples Before Practice

- Show complete solutions first
- Explain step-by-step
- Then ask readers to practice
- Reduces cognitive load of problem-solving while learning

**Pattern:**

1. Show complete example with explanation
2. Show similar example with partial explanation
3. Ask reader to complete similar task
4. Provide independent challenge

#### 4. Dual Coding (Text + Visual)

- Use diagrams to complement text
- Code examples with visual flow diagrams
- Screenshots of results
- Reduces cognitive load by distributing across channels

**Effective Visuals:**

- Architecture diagrams
- Flow charts
- Sequence diagrams
- Database schemas
- API request/response flows

---

## Adult Learning Principles

Adult learners have specific characteristics that affect technical book design.

### Key Principles

#### 1. Adults are Self-Directed

- Provide clear learning paths
- Explain the "why" not just "what"
- Allow exploration and experimentation
- Respect prior experience

**Application:**

- Clear objectives upfront
- Optional "deep dive" sections
- Multiple approaches shown
- Encourage adaptation to needs

#### 2. Adults Need Relevance

- Real-world examples
- Practical applications
- Career relevance
- Immediate applicability

**Application:**

- Start chapters with real-world problems
- Show industry use cases
- Explain job market demand
- Provide production-ready patterns

#### 3. Adults are Problem-Oriented

- Learn best through solving problems
- Prefer practical over theoretical
- Want working solutions
- Value hands-on practice

**Application:**

- Problem-based learning approach
- Tutorials over lectures
- Working code examples
- Real projects

#### 4. Adults Bring Experience

- Acknowledge existing knowledge
- Build on prior experience
- Allow knowledge transfer
- Respect diverse backgrounds

**Application:**

- State prerequisites clearly
- Reference common experiences
- Compare to known technologies
- Provide multiple analogies

---

## Applying These Frameworks Together

### Book-Level Application

**Part I: Foundations (Bloom's: Remember + Understand)**

- Scaffolding: Concrete examples first
- Cognitive Load: Small chunks, progressive disclosure
- Adult Learning: Show relevance and practical use

**Part II: Application (Bloom's: Apply + Analyze)**

- Scaffolding: Guided tutorials with gradual independence
- Cognitive Load: Worked examples before practice
- Adult Learning: Problem-based approach

**Part III: Mastery (Bloom's: Evaluate + Create)**

- Scaffolding: Independent challenges
- Cognitive Load: Integrate prior knowledge
- Adult Learning: Real-world projects

### Chapter-Level Application

1. **Introduction**: Activate prior knowledge (scaffolding), show relevance (adult learning)
2. **Concepts**: Manage cognitive load (chunking), start concrete (scaffolding)
3. **Tutorials**: Worked examples (cognitive load), problem-oriented (adult learning)
4. **Exercises**: Progress to independence (scaffolding), higher Bloom's levels
5. **Summary**: Reinforce learning, connect to next chapter
