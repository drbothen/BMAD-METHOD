# Web Agent Bundle Instructions

You are now operating as a specialized AI agent from the BMad-Method framework. This is a bundled web-compatible version containing all necessary resources for your role.

## Important Instructions

1. **Follow all startup commands**: Your agent configuration includes startup instructions that define your behavior, personality, and approach. These MUST be followed exactly.

2. **Resource Navigation**: This bundle contains all resources you need. Resources are marked with tags like:

- `==================== START: .bmad-technical-writing/folder/filename.md ====================`
- `==================== END: .bmad-technical-writing/folder/filename.md ====================`

When you need to reference a resource mentioned in your instructions:

- Look for the corresponding START/END tags
- The format is always the full path with dot prefix (e.g., `.bmad-technical-writing/personas/analyst.md`, `.bmad-technical-writing/tasks/create-story.md`)
- If a section is specified (e.g., `{root}/tasks/create-story.md#section-name`), navigate to that section within the file

**Understanding YAML References**: In the agent configuration, resources are referenced in the dependencies section. For example:

```yaml
dependencies:
  utils:
    - template-format
  tasks:
    - create-story
```

These references map directly to bundle sections:

- `utils: template-format` → Look for `==================== START: .bmad-technical-writing/utils/template-format.md ====================`
- `tasks: create-story` → Look for `==================== START: .bmad-technical-writing/tasks/create-story.md ====================`

3. **Execution Context**: You are operating in a web environment. All your capabilities and knowledge are contained within this bundle. Work within these constraints to provide the best possible assistance.

4. **Primary Directive**: Your primary goal is defined in your agent configuration below. Focus on fulfilling your designated role according to the BMad-Method framework.

- Security scanner dependencies may conflict
- Use separate virtual environments per tool
- Consider containerized scanning approach
- Document any tool limitations

**Language-Specific Challenges:**

_JavaScript:_

- Large dependency trees create noise
- Focus on direct dependencies first
- Use `npm audit --production` for prod deps only

_Python:_

- Virtual environment setup crucial
- Bandit may have false positives on test code
- Use `# nosec` comments judiciously with explanation

_Ruby:_

- Brakeman is Rails-specific
- Use standard Ruby scanners for non-Rails code

_Go:_

- gosec sometimes flags safe uses of crypto/rand
- Review findings in context

_Java:_

- Tool configuration can be complex
- May need to adjust Maven/Gradle settings

### 10. Remediate and Retest

For each vulnerability:

**Remediation Process:**

1. Understand the vulnerability thoroughly
2. Research secure alternative approaches
3. Implement fix or update documentation
4. Test fix doesn't break functionality
5. Rerun security scan to verify fix
6. Update audit report status
7. Document fix in code comments if needed

**Verification:**

- Rerun all scanners after fixes
- Verify vulnerability no longer detected
- Check fix doesn't introduce new issues
- Update security audit report

## Success Criteria

A complete security audit has:

- [ ] All code files identified and scanned
- [ ] Automated security scanners run successfully
- [ ] Manual security review completed
- [ ] security-best-practices-checklist.md completed
- [ ] All findings documented with severity levels
- [ ] Remediation guidance provided for each issue
- [ ] Security audit report generated
- [ ] Critical and High issues resolved or documented
- [ ] Code safe for publication

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Relying only on automated tools**: Manual review is essential
- **Ignoring false positives**: Document why flagged code is safe
- **Not testing security fixes**: Ensure fixes work and don't break code
- **Missing dependency vulnerabilities**: Always check dependencies
- **Ignoring language-specific risks**: Each language has unique patterns
- **No severity classification**: Not all issues are equal
- **Poor documentation**: Future reviewers need context
- **Not updating checklists**: Security standards evolve
- **Publishing with critical issues**: Never acceptable
- **No retest after fixes**: Verify remediation worked

# Cross-Platform Test

---

task:
id: cross-platform-test
name: Cross-Platform Test
description: Test code examples across multiple platforms to ensure cross-platform compatibility
persona_default: code-curator
inputs: - code_path - target_platforms - language
steps: - Identify target platforms and code to test - Review cross-platform-checklist.md for platform-specific concerns - Set up testing environments (Windows, macOS, Linux) - Test code on each platform - Document platform-specific behaviors - Identify compatibility issues - Provide platform-specific fixes or workarounds - Generate cross-platform compatibility report
output: docs/testing/cross-platform-report.md

---

## Purpose

This task guides you through testing code examples across Windows, macOS, and Linux to ensure they work correctly on all target platforms. Technical books often have readers on different operating systems, so cross-platform compatibility is essential for reader success.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this task:

- Code examples have been created and work on at least one platform
- Target platforms identified (Windows, macOS, Linux, or specific versions)
- Access to testing environments for each platform
- Access to cross-platform-checklist.md
- Understanding of common cross-platform issues

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Identify Target Platforms and Scope

Define testing scope:

**Platform Selection:**

Choose based on target audience:

- **Windows**: Windows 10, Windows 11
- **macOS**: Latest 2-3 versions (e.g., Sonoma, Ventura)
- **Linux**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, Debian, Fedora, or relevant distros

**Code Inventory:**

- List all code files to test
- Identify platform-sensitive code (file I/O, paths, shell commands)
- Note system-level operations
- Flag code with OS-specific APIs
- Identify GUI or terminal applications

**Priority Assessment:**

- **High priority**: Code with file paths, shell commands, environment variables
- **Medium priority**: Code with networking, process management
- **Low priority**: Pure logic, calculations (still test to verify)

### 2. Review Cross-Platform Concerns

Use cross-platform-checklist.md to identify potential issues:

**File Path Issues:**

- [ ] Path separators (/ vs \)
- [ ] Drive letters (C:\ on Windows)
- [ ] Case sensitivity differences
- [ ] Path length limits
- [ ] Special characters in filenames
- [ ] Home directory references

**Line Ending Issues:**

- [ ] LF (Unix/Mac) vs CRLF (Windows)
- [ ] File reading/writing modes
- [ ] Git line ending handling
- [ ] Text vs binary mode

**Environment Variables:**

- [ ] Setting environment variables differs
- [ ] Variable name casing (case-sensitive on Unix)
- [ ] Path separators in PATH variable
- [ ] Default environment variables differ

**Shell Commands:**

- [ ] bash (Unix/Mac) vs cmd/PowerShell (Windows)
- [ ] Command availability differences
- [ ] Command syntax differences
- [ ] Path to executables

**Platform Detection:**

- [ ] Code needs to detect platform
- [ ] Platform-specific code branches
- [ ] Graceful fallbacks

### 3. Set Up Testing Environments

Create testing environments for each platform:

#### Option A: Physical/Virtual Machines

**Windows Testing:**

```bash
# Use Windows 10/11 machine or VM
# Install required runtimes
# - Python: python.org installer
# - Node.js: nodejs.org installer
# - Ruby: RubyInstaller
# - Go: golang.org installer
```

**macOS Testing:**

```bash
# Use Mac machine or VM (requires Apple hardware)
# Install Homebrew
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install runtimes via Homebrew
brew install python node ruby go
```

**Linux Testing:**

```bash
# Use Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (most common)
# Update system
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

# Install runtimes
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip nodejs npm ruby golang
```

#### Option B: Docker Containers (Recommended)

Create Dockerfiles for each platform:

**Windows Container (using Wine or Windows Server Core):**

```dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:ltsc2022
# Install required runtimes
# Note: Windows containers require Windows host
```

**Linux Container:**

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:22.04

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    python3 python3-pip \
    nodejs npm \
    ruby \
    golang \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

WORKDIR /code
```

**macOS Testing:**

- Docker Desktop on Mac tests Linux behavior
- Use physical Mac or CI/CD for true macOS testing

#### Option C: CI/CD Matrix Testing (Best for automation)

**GitHub Actions Example:**

```yaml
name: Cross-Platform Test

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
        language-version: ['3.11', '3.12']

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up language
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.language-version }}
      - name: Run tests
        run: python test_examples.py
```

### 4. Test Code on Each Platform

For each platform, systematically test all code:

#### Testing Checklist Per Platform

**Pre-Test Setup:**

- [ ] Fresh environment (clean install or new container)
- [ ] Document exact OS version
- [ ] Document runtime version
- [ ] Install only documented dependencies
- [ ] Note installation commands used

**Test Execution:**

**Step 1: Dependency Installation**

```bash
# Test that installation commands work
# Windows (PowerShell)
PS> pip install -r requirements.txt

# macOS/Linux
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Document any platform-specific installation issues
```

**Step 2: Run Code Examples**

```bash
# Execute each code example exactly as documented
# Windows
PS> python example.py

# macOS/Linux
$ python3 example.py

# Capture full output
```

**Step 3: Verify Output**

- Compare output across platforms
- Check for differences in formatting
- Verify functionality works correctly
- Note any platform-specific output

**Step 4: Test Edge Cases**

- Test with paths containing spaces
- Test with special characters
- Test with long paths
- Test with non-ASCII characters (Unicode)
- Test with symlinks (on platforms that support them)

**Step 5: Document Results**

Use this format:

```markdown
## Test Results: [Platform Name]

**Platform Details:**

- OS: Windows 11 / macOS 14 Sonoma / Ubuntu 22.04
- Runtime: Python 3.11.5
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD

**Example: example.py**

- Status: ✅ PASS / ⚠️ WARNING / ❌ FAIL
- Output matches documentation: Yes/No
- Platform-specific notes: [Any differences]
- Issues found: [List any issues]
```

### 5. Identify Platform-Specific Issues

Common cross-platform issues to watch for:

#### Path-Related Issues

**Issue: Hardcoded path separators**

```python
# ❌ Fails on Windows
file_path = "data/files/example.txt"  # Uses /

# ✅ Cross-platform
from pathlib import Path
file_path = Path("data") / "files" / "example.txt"
```

**Issue: Absolute paths**

```python
# ❌ Unix-only
file_path = "/home/user/data.txt"

# ❌ Windows-only
file_path = "C:\\Users\\user\\data.txt"

# ✅ Cross-platform
from pathlib import Path
file_path = Path.home() / "data.txt"
```

#### Line Ending Issues

**Issue: File writing without newline parameter**

```python
# ❌ Platform-dependent line endings
with open("file.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("line1\n")

# ✅ Explicit line ending handling
with open("file.txt", "w", newline="\n") as f:
    f.write("line1\n")
```

#### Shell Command Issues

**Issue: Platform-specific commands**

```python
# ❌ Unix-only
import subprocess
subprocess.run(["ls", "-la"])

# ✅ Cross-platform using Python
import os
for item in os.listdir("."):
    print(item)

# Or provide platform-specific alternatives
import platform
if platform.system() == "Windows":
    subprocess.run(["dir"], shell=True)
else:
    subprocess.run(["ls", "-la"])
```

#### Environment Variable Issues

**Issue: Setting environment variables**

```bash
# ❌ Unix-only syntax in documentation
export API_KEY="secret"

# ✅ Document both
# Unix/macOS:
export API_KEY="secret"

# Windows (PowerShell):
$env:API_KEY="secret"

# Windows (cmd):
set API_KEY=secret
```

#### Unicode and Encoding Issues

**Issue: Platform default encodings differ**

```python
# ❌ Uses platform default encoding
with open("file.txt", "r") as f:
    content = f.read()

# ✅ Explicit encoding
with open("file.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    content = f.read()
```

### 6. Document Platform-Specific Behaviors

Note legitimate platform differences:

**Expected Differences:**

- Performance variations
- File system operation speeds
- Default installed tools
- System paths and locations
- Available system resources

**Unexpected Differences (require fixing):**

- Code works on one platform, fails on another
- Different outputs for same input
- Missing functionality on a platform
- Crashes or errors

### 7. Provide Fixes and Workarounds

For each incompatibility found:

**Fix Documentation Template:**

````markdown
### Platform Incompatibility: [Issue Title]

**Affected Platforms:** Windows / macOS / Linux

**Issue:**
[Describe what doesn't work]

**Root Cause:**
[Explain why the issue occurs]

**Fix Option 1: Cross-Platform Code**

```python
# Recommended fix that works on all platforms
```
````

**Fix Option 2: Platform-Specific Code**

```python
import platform
if platform.system() == "Windows":
    # Windows-specific code
elif platform.system() == "Darwin":  # macOS
    # macOS-specific code
else:  # Linux and others
    # Unix-like code
```

**Fix Option 3: Update Documentation**
[If code is correct but docs need platform-specific instructions]

**Testing:**

- [x] Tested on Windows
- [x] Tested on macOS
- [x] Tested on Linux

````

### 8. Run Cross-Platform Checklist

Execute execute-checklist.md task with cross-platform-checklist.md:

- Systematically verify each checklist item
- Document any issues found
- Ensure comprehensive coverage
- Update checklist if new issues discovered

### 9. Generate Cross-Platform Compatibility Report

Create comprehensive report:

**Report Structure:**

```markdown
# Cross-Platform Compatibility Report

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Tester:** [Name]
**Code Version:** [Commit hash or version]
**Languages:** [JavaScript, Python, etc.]

### 10. Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Cannot Access Platform:**
- Use cloud-based testing services (BrowserStack, LambdaTest)
- Use GitHub Actions or similar CI/CD
- Use Docker for Linux testing
- Ask beta readers to test on their platforms

**Dependency Installation Fails:**
- Document platform-specific dependencies
- Provide alternative packages if available
- Use virtual environments to isolate
- Document exact error messages and solutions

**Intermittent Failures:**
- May be race conditions or timing issues
- Test multiple times
- Check for platform-specific timing differences
- Add appropriate delays if needed

**Permission Issues:**
- Linux/macOS: May need sudo for some operations
- Windows: May need Administrator
- Document privilege requirements clearly
- Avoid requiring elevated privileges if possible

**Path Too Long (Windows):**
- Windows has 260-character path limit (unless modified)
- Use shorter paths in examples
- Document workaround (enable long paths in Windows)
- Test with realistic path lengths

**File Locking Differences:**
- Windows locks files more aggressively
- Ensure files closed properly
- Use context managers (with statement)
- Test file operations thoroughly on Windows

## Success Criteria

A complete cross-platform test has:

- [ ] All target platforms tested
- [ ] Testing environments documented
- [ ] Every code example tested on every platform
- [ ] Platform-specific behaviors documented
- [ ] Incompatibilities identified and fixed
- [ ] cross-platform-checklist.md completed
- [ ] Installation instructions verified on all platforms
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility report generated
- [ ] All critical issues resolved
- [ ] Code works correctly on all target platforms

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Testing only on your primary platform**: Test on ALL targets
- **Using platform-specific features without checking**: Always verify
- **Hardcoding paths**: Use path manipulation libraries
- **Assuming case sensitivity**: Windows is case-insensitive, Unix is not
- **Not documenting platform differences**: Readers need to know
- **Using shell commands without alternatives**: Provide cross-platform options
- **Ignoring line endings**: Can cause subtle bugs
- **Not testing installation**: Installation often fails first
- **Skipping edge cases**: Test special characters, spaces, etc.
- **No CI/CD automation**: Manual testing is error-prone

## Cross-Platform Testing Tools

**Multi-Platform CI/CD:**
- GitHub Actions (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- GitLab CI (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- CircleCI (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Azure Pipelines (Windows, macOS, Linux)

**Containerization:**
- Docker (Linux containers, Windows containers)
- Podman (alternative to Docker)
- LXC/LXD (Linux containers)

**Virtualization:**
- VirtualBox (free, all platforms)
- VMware (Windows, Linux)
- Parallels (macOS)
- QEMU (all platforms)

**Cloud Testing:**
- AWS EC2 (Windows, Linux)

# Execute Checklist

---

task:
id: execute-checklist
name: Execute Checklist
description: Systematically execute checklist items with pass/fail/na status and evidence collection for quality assurance
persona_default: technical-reviewer
inputs: - checklist_path - subject_name - context_notes
steps: - Load and parse checklist file - Process each category and item sequentially - Evaluate and mark status (PASS/FAIL/NA) with evidence - Generate results report with summary statistics - Save results to standard location
output: reviews/checklist-results/{{checklist-name}}-{{timestamp}}.md

---

## Purpose

This task provides a structured way to execute quality checklists and document results. It ensures all checklist items are systematically evaluated with evidence, creating an auditable record of quality gate execution.

## Prerequisites

- Checklist file exists and is accessible
- Subject material to be reviewed is available
- Understanding of checklist criteria
- Authority to evaluate against checklist standards

## Inputs

**Required:**

- `checklist_path`: Path to the checklist markdown file (e.g., `checklists/code-quality-checklist.md`)
- `subject_name`: Descriptive name of what's being checked (e.g., "Chapter 3: Database Design", "User Authentication Module")

**Optional:**

- `context_notes`: Additional context for the review (e.g., "First draft", "Post-revision", "Version 2.0 update")

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Load Checklist File

Load and parse the checklist:

- Read the checklist file from `checklist_path`
- Identify all categories (markdown H2 headings)
- Extract all checklist items (lines starting with `- [ ]`)
- Count total items for summary statistics
- Verify checklist structure is valid

**Validation:**

- File exists and is readable
- Contains at least one category
- Contains at least one checklist item
- Items follow standard markdown checkbox format

### 2. Initialize Results Document

Create the results file structure:

- Generate timestamp for unique filename
- Extract checklist name from file path
- Create results file path: `reviews/checklist-results/{{checklist-name}}-{{timestamp}}.md`
- Initialize document with header information:
  - Subject name
  - Date and time
  - Checklist source path
  - Context notes (if provided)

**Note:** Results are saved incrementally as you progress through the checklist.

### 3. Process Each Category

Work through checklist categories systematically:

For each category (H2 section):

1. **Announce category**: State which category you're evaluating
2. **Read all items in category**: Get overview of what's being checked
3. **Process items sequentially**: Work through each checkbox item

**Process Flow:**

- Category 1 → All items → Results saved
- Category 2 → All items → Results saved
- Continue until all categories complete

### 4. Evaluate Each Checklist Item

For each checklist item, perform systematic evaluation:

**Evaluation Process:**

1. **Read the item**: Understand what's being checked
2. **Examine the subject**: Review relevant content/code/documentation
3. **Make determination**: Decide on status
4. **Document evidence**: Record specific findings

**Status Values:**

- **✅ PASS**: Item meets criteria fully
  - Provide brief evidence or write "Confirmed"
  - Example: "All code examples follow PEP 8 style guide"

- **❌ FAIL**: Item does not meet criteria
  - Document specific issue found
  - Explain why it fails
  - Provide recommendation for fix
  - Example: "Function `calculateTotal` missing error handling for empty cart scenario. Add validation before processing."

- **⊘ N/A**: Item not applicable to this subject
  - Explain why it doesn't apply
  - Example: "No JavaScript code in this chapter, checklist item not applicable"

**Evidence Requirements:**

- PASS: Brief confirmation or location reference
- FAIL: Detailed explanation with location and recommendation
- N/A: Reason for non-applicability

### 5. Handle Failed Items

When checklist item fails:

**Document Failure:**

- Mark status as ❌ FAIL
- Record specific location of issue (section, file, line number)
- Describe what was found vs what was expected
- Provide actionable recommendation for fixing

**Continue Execution:**

- Do NOT halt on failures (except critical issues - see below)
- Continue through all remaining items
- Capture complete picture of all issues

**Halt Immediately Only For:**

- Critical security vulnerabilities (exposed credentials, SQL injection)
- Data loss risks or corruption
- Legal/compliance violations
- Plagiarism or copyright infringement

If you encounter a halt-worthy issue:

1. Mark the item as ❌ FAIL with detailed explanation
2. Note "CRITICAL ISSUE - EXECUTION HALTED" in results
3. Stop checklist execution
4. Alert user immediately

### 6. Generate Summary Statistics

After all items processed (or if halted):

Calculate and include:

- **Total Items**: Count of all checklist items
- **Passed**: Count and percentage of PASS items
- **Failed**: Count and percentage of FAIL items
- **N/A**: Count and percentage of N/A items
- **Completion**: Percentage of applicable items that passed

**Overall Status Determination:**

- **PASS**: All applicable items passed (100% of PASS/(PASS+FAIL))
- **PASS WITH CONCERNS**: 80-99% pass rate, minor issues present
- **FAIL**: Less than 80% pass rate, significant issues present
- **CRITICAL FAILURE**: Execution halted due to critical issue

### 7. Create Failed Items Priority Section

If any items failed:

Create a dedicated section listing all failures:

**For Each Failed Item:**

- Category and item text
- Status: FAIL
- Evidence: Full details of what was found
- Location: Specific reference (section, file, line)
- Recommendation: How to fix the issue
- Priority: Based on severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)

**Purpose:** Provides quick reference for remediation work

### 8. Add Recommendations

Include actionable next steps:

**Recommendations based on overall status:**

- **PASS**: Subject meets all checklist criteria, ready to proceed
- **PASS WITH CONCERNS**: Address failed items before final approval
- **FAIL**: Must address all failures before proceeding
- **CRITICAL FAILURE**: Stop all work, address critical issue immediately

**Include:**

- Priority order for addressing failures
- Estimated effort for remediation
- Suggested next steps in workflow

### 9. Save Results

Save the complete results document:

- Write to `reviews/checklist-results/{{checklist-name}}-{{timestamp}}.md`
- Ensure directory exists (create if needed)
- Verify file was written successfully
- Provide user with results file path

**Results file includes:**

- Header with metadata
- Summary statistics
- Results by category (table format)
- Failed items priority section
- Recommendations
- Timestamp and audit trail

## Output Format

Results file structure:

```markdown

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Checklist file not found

- Verify file path is correct relative to project root
- Check file extension is `.md`
- Ensure file exists in expected location

**Issue**: No checklist items detected

- Verify checklist uses standard markdown checkbox format: `- [ ] Item text`
- Check for proper category headings (H2: `## Category Name`)
- Ensure file is not empty or malformed

**Issue**: Unclear how to evaluate item

- Read item carefully and interpret based on context
- Refer to subject material being reviewed
- If truly ambiguous, mark as N/A and note ambiguity in evidence
- Consider consulting checklist owner or subject matter expert

**Issue**: Too many failures to track

- Continue execution, document all failures
- Use Failed Items Priority Section to organize
- Consider if subject needs major rework before continuing
- May indicate checklist mismatch with subject maturity

**Issue**: Results directory doesn't exist

- Create `reviews/checklist-results/` directory structure
- Ensure write permissions
- Verify project root location

# Version Check

---

task:
id: version-check
name: Version Check
description: Verify code compatibility across multiple language versions with automated testing
persona_default: code-curator
inputs: - code_path (file or directory to test) - language (javascript|python|ruby|java|go) - version_matrix (e.g., "Node 16,18,20" or "Python 3.9,3.10,3.11")
steps: - Parse target versions from version_matrix input - Set up testing environments for each version (Docker or version managers) - Execute code on each version - Capture output, errors, and warnings - Compare results across versions - Identify version-specific issues (deprecated APIs, syntax changes, breaking changes) - Generate compatibility matrix report - Run execute-checklist.md with version-compatibility-checklist.md - Document recommendations for version support
output: docs/testing/version-compatibility-report.md

---

## Purpose

This task ensures code examples work correctly across multiple versions of programming languages and runtimes. Version compatibility is critical for technical books because readers use different environments. A thorough version check catches breaking changes, deprecated APIs, and version-specific behaviors before readers encounter them.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this task:

- Code examples have been created and are ready to test
- Target versions identified (e.g., Node 16/18/20, Python 3.9/3.10/3.11)
- Docker installed for isolated testing environments (recommended)
- OR version managers installed (nvm, pyenv, rbenv, SDKMAN, etc.)
- version-compatibility-checklist.md available
- Basic understanding of the language being tested

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Parse Version Matrix

Extract target versions from input:

**Input Format Examples:**

- JavaScript: `"Node 16.20.0, 18.16.0, 20.2.0"` or `"Node 16,18,20"` (latest minor)
- Python: `"Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11"` or `"Python 3.9.18, 3.10.13, 3.11.5"`
- Ruby: `"Ruby 2.7, 3.0, 3.1"`
- Java: `"OpenJDK 11, 17, 21"`
- Go: `"Go 1.19, 1.20, 1.21"`

**Parsing Steps:**

1. Split version string by commas
2. Trim whitespace
3. Validate version format
4. Determine if full version (3.9.18) or major.minor (3.9)
5. For major.minor, use latest patch version available

### 2. Set Up Testing Environments

Choose testing approach based on requirements:

#### Option A: Docker-Based Testing (Recommended)

**Benefits:**

- Clean, isolated environments
- No system pollution
- Reproducible across machines
- Easy CI/CD integration
- Platform independence

**JavaScript/Node Example:**

```bash
# Test Node 16
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app -w /app node:16 node example.js

# Test Node 18
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app -w /app node:18 node example.js

# Test Node 20
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app -w /app node:20 node example.js
```

**Python Example:**

```bash
# Test Python 3.9
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app -w /app python:3.9 python example.py

# Test Python 3.10
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app -w /app python:3.10 python example.py

# Test Python 3.11
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app -w /app python:3.11 python example.py
```

#### Option B: Version Managers

**JavaScript/Node: nvm**

```bash
# Install versions
nvm install 16
nvm install 18
nvm install 20

# Test each version
nvm use 16 && node example.js
nvm use 18 && node example.js
nvm use 20 && node example.js
```

**Python: pyenv**

```bash
# Install versions
pyenv install 3.9.18
pyenv install 3.10.13
pyenv install 3.11.5

# Test each version
pyenv shell 3.9.18 && python example.py
pyenv shell 3.10.13 && python example.py
pyenv shell 3.11.5 && python example.py
```

**Ruby: rbenv**

```bash
# Install versions
rbenv install 2.7.8
rbenv install 3.0.6
rbenv install 3.1.4

# Test each version
rbenv shell 2.7.8 && ruby example.rb
rbenv shell 3.0.6 && ruby example.rb
rbenv shell 3.1.4 && ruby example.rb
```

**Java: SDKMAN**

```bash
# Install versions
sdk install java 11.0.20-tem
sdk install java 17.0.8-tem
sdk install java 21.0.0-tem

# Test each version
sdk use java 11.0.20-tem && java Example.java
sdk use java 17.0.8-tem && java Example.java
sdk use java 21.0.0-tem && java Example.java
```

**Go: Direct Docker (Go doesn't need system-wide version manager)**

```bash
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app -w /app golang:1.19 go run example.go
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app -w /app golang:1.20 go run example.go
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app -w /app golang:1.21 go run example.go
```

### 3. Execute Code on Each Version

For every version in the matrix:

**Step 1: Install Dependencies**

```bash
# JavaScript/Node
npm install

# Python
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Ruby
bundle install

# Java
mvn install

# Go
go mod download
```

**Step 2: Run Code**

Execute the code exactly as documented:

```bash
# Capture stdout, stderr, and exit code
<command> > output.txt 2> error.txt
echo $? > exitcode.txt
```

**Step 3: Record Results**

Capture:

- Exit code (0 = success, non-zero = failure)
- Standard output
- Standard error (including warnings)
- Execution time
- Any deprecation warnings

### 4. Compare Results Across Versions

Analyze differences between versions:

**Comparison Checklist:**

- [ ] **Exit codes**: Do all versions succeed (exit 0)?
- [ ] **Output**: Is output identical across versions?
- [ ] **Warnings**: Are there deprecation warnings in some versions?
- [ ] **Errors**: Do any versions produce errors?
- [ ] **Performance**: Are there significant speed differences?
- [ ] **Features**: Are any features unavailable in older versions?

**Common Version Issues:**

1. **New Features**: Feature added in newer version (e.g., Fetch API in Node 18+)
2. **Deprecated Features**: Feature works but shows deprecation warning
3. **Breaking Changes**: API changed between versions
4. **Syntax Changes**: Language syntax evolved (e.g., Python 3.10 match-case)
5. **Performance**: Algorithm or runtime improvements in newer versions
6. **Bug Fixes**: Bug present in older version, fixed in newer

### 5. Identify Version-Specific Issues

For each incompatibility found:

**Document:**

1. **Which versions are affected?** (e.g., "Node 16 only", "Python 3.9 and below")
2. **What is the symptom?** (error message, warning, different output)
3. **What is the cause?** (API change, new feature, deprecation)
4. **What is the impact?** (code doesn't run, works with warning, different behavior)
5. **What is the solution?** (upgrade requirement, polyfill, conditional code, separate examples)

**Example Issue Documentation:**

```markdown
### Issue: Fetch API Not Available in Node 16

**Affected Versions:** Node 16.x
**Working Versions:** Node 18+, Node 20+

**Symptom:**
```

ReferenceError: fetch is not defined

```

**Cause:** The global `fetch()` API was added in Node 18.0.0. Node 16 requires a polyfill like `node-fetch`.

**Impact:** Code example using `fetch()` will fail on Node 16.

**Solutions:**
1. **Option A**: Require Node 18+ (recommended for new books)
2. **Option B**: Use `node-fetch` polyfill for Node 16 support
3. **Option C**: Provide separate examples for Node 16 and Node 18+

**Recommendation:** Update book requirements to Node 18+ LTS.
```

### 6. Generate Compatibility Matrix

Create visual compatibility report:

**Compatibility Matrix Template:**

```markdown
## Version Compatibility Report

**Code Path:** `examples/chapter-03/`
**Languages Tested:** JavaScript (Node.js)
**Versions Tested:** Node 16.20.0, 18.16.0, 20.2.0
**Test Date:** 2024-10-24
**Tester:** code-curator agent

### Summary

| Metric                | Value   |
| --------------------- | ------- |
| Total Examples        | 12      |
| Fully Compatible      | 8 (67%) |
| Partial Compatibility | 3 (25%) |
| Incompatible          | 1 (8%)  |

### Detailed Results

| Example                | Node 16    | Node 18    | Node 20 | Notes                                |
| ---------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `hello-world.js`       | ✅ PASS    | ✅ PASS    | ✅ PASS | Fully compatible                     |
| `async-await.js`       | ✅ PASS    | ✅ PASS    | ✅ PASS | Fully compatible                     |
| `fetch-api.js`         | ❌ FAIL    | ✅ PASS    | ✅ PASS | Requires Node 18+                    |
| `top-level-await.js`   | ⚠️ PARTIAL | ✅ PASS    | ✅ PASS | Needs --experimental flag in Node 16 |
| `import-assertions.js` | ⚠️ PARTIAL | ⚠️ PARTIAL | ✅ PASS | Stabilized in Node 20                |
| `crypto-webcrypto.js`  | ✅ PASS    | ✅ PASS    | ✅ PASS | Available all versions               |

### Legend

- ✅ **PASS**: Works without modification or warnings
- ⚠️ **PARTIAL**: Works with modifications or shows warnings
- ❌ **FAIL**: Does not work on this version

### Version-Specific Issues

#### Issue 1: Fetch API Unavailable (Node 16)

- **Affected Examples:** `fetch-api.js`, `http-client.js`
- **Impact:** 2 examples fail on Node 16
- **Recommendation:** Require Node 18+ or provide polyfill

#### Issue 2: Top-Level Await Requires Flag (Node 16)

- **Affected Examples:** `top-level-await.js`
- **Impact:** Works with `--experimental-top-level-await` flag
- **Recommendation:** Add note about flag requirement for Node 16 users

### Recommendations

1. **Minimum Version**: Set Node 18 as minimum requirement
2. **Update Documentation**: Add version compatibility table to README
3. **Code Changes**: Update `fetch-api.js` to check for fetch availability
4. **Reader Guidance**: Add troubleshooting section for version issues
```

### 7. Run Version-Compatibility Checklist

Execute checklist validation:

```bash
# Using execute-checklist.md task
execute-checklist version-compatibility-checklist.md
```

Ensure:

- [ ] All target versions tested
- [ ] Compatibility matrix created
- [ ] Version-specific issues documented
- [ ] Recommendations provided
- [ ] Minimum version requirement clear
- [ ] Troubleshooting guidance included

### 8. Document Recommendations

Provide actionable next steps:

**For Book Requirements:**

- Should minimum version be raised?
- Should polyfills be added?
- Should version-specific examples be created?

**For Code Updates:**

- Which examples need fixes?
- Which need version checks?
- Which need alternative implementations?

**For Documentation:**

- What version notes should be added?
- What troubleshooting guidance is needed?
- What should the version support policy state?

## Success Criteria

Version check is complete when:

- [ ] All versions in matrix tested successfully
- [ ] Every code example tested on every version
- [ ] Results captured (output, errors, warnings, exit codes)
- [ ] Differences between versions identified
- [ ] Version-specific issues documented with causes and solutions
- [ ] Compatibility matrix generated and reviewed
- [ ] version-compatibility-checklist.md completed
- [ ] Recommendations provided for version support strategy
- [ ] Testing approach documented for future updates

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Incomplete testing**: Test ALL versions, not just newest/oldest
- **Ignoring warnings**: Deprecation warnings signal future problems
- **Cached dependencies**: Use clean environments to avoid false positives
- **Platform assumptions**: Docker images may differ from native installations
- **Missing exit codes**: Check exit codes, not just output
- **No automation**: Manual testing is error-prone; automate where possible
- **Undocumented workarounds**: Document all flags, polyfills, or workarounds needed
- **Ignoring performance**: Significant performance differences may affect examples

# Optimize Code

---

task:
id: optimize-code
name: Optimize Code
description: Improve code clarity, readability, and efficiency for technical documentation
persona_default: code-curator
inputs: - code_path (file or directory containing code to optimize) - optimization_goals (clarity|performance|both) - target_audience (beginner|intermediate|advanced)
steps: - Read and analyze existing code - Identify optimization opportunities based on goals - For clarity optimizations, improve naming, comments, structure, and readability - For performance optimizations, improve algorithms, data structures, and efficiency - Create before/after examples with annotations - Explain rationale for each optimization - Include performance benchmarks if applicable - Run execute-checklist.md with code-quality-checklist.md - Generate optimization recommendations report
output: docs/optimization/{{code-name}}-optimization-report.md

---

## Purpose

This task improves code examples for technical books by optimizing for clarity (teaching effectiveness) and/or performance (demonstrating best practices). Code in technical documentation serves a different purpose than production code—it must be exceptionally clear, well-explained, and demonstrate best practices while remaining concise enough to include in a book.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this task:

- Code examples have been created
- Optimization goals defined (clarity, performance, or both)
- Target audience identified (affects complexity choices)
- code-quality-checklist.md available
- code-style-guides.md knowledge base accessible

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Analyze Existing Code

Read and understand the code thoroughly:

**Initial Analysis Checklist:**

- [ ] What does this code do? (purpose)
- [ ] What concepts does it teach? (learning objectives)
- [ ] Who is the audience? (skill level)
- [ ] What is the code's current complexity? (basic/intermediate/advanced)
- [ ] Are there obvious issues? (bugs, anti-patterns, inefficiencies)
- [ ] Does it follow language conventions? (style guide compliance)

**Code Quality Assessment:**

Rate current code on each dimension (1-5 scale):

- **Clarity**: Are variable/function names descriptive?
- **Readability**: Is the structure easy to follow?
- **Comments**: Do comments explain WHY, not WHAT?
- **Simplicity**: Is this the simplest approach?
- **Correctness**: Does it work correctly?
- **Efficiency**: Are there obvious performance issues?
- **Maintainability**: Could someone easily modify this?

### 2. Identify Optimization Opportunities

Based on optimization goals, find improvements:

#### Clarity Optimizations (Priority for Technical Books)

**A. Naming Improvements**

❌ **Poor Naming:**

```python
def calc(a, b, c):
    r = a + b * c
    return r
```

✅ **Clear Naming:**

```python
def calculate_total_price(base_price, quantity, tax_rate):
    total = base_price + (quantity * tax_rate)
    return total
```

**Naming Checklist:**

- [ ] Variables: Descriptive nouns (user_count, not uc)
- [ ] Functions: Verb phrases (calculate_total, not calc)
- [ ] Classes: Nouns (CustomerAccount, not CA)
- [ ] Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (MAX_CONNECTIONS)
- [ ] Booleans: is/has/can prefix (is_valid, has_permission)

**B. Comment Improvements**

❌ **Bad Comments (explain WHAT):**

```javascript
// Increment counter
counter++;

// Loop through array
for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
```

✅ **Good Comments (explain WHY):**

```javascript
// Track retry attempts for exponential backoff calculation
retryCount++;

// Process items sequentially to maintain insertion order
for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
```

**Comment Guidelines:**

- Explain design decisions and tradeoffs
- Highlight non-obvious logic
- Warn about gotchas or edge cases
- Link to relevant documentation
- Don't explain obvious syntax

**C. Simplify Complex Expressions**

❌ **Complex Expression:**

```python
result = data[0] if len(data) > 0 and data[0] is not None and data[0].value > 0 else default_value
```

✅ **Simplified with Explanatory Variables:**

```python
has_data = len(data) > 0
first_item_valid = data[0] is not None
has_positive_value = data[0].value > 0

result = data[0] if has_data and first_item_valid and has_positive_value else default_value
```

**D. Extract Magic Numbers to Constants**

❌ **Magic Numbers:**

```java
if (age >= 18 && score > 75) {
    timeout = 3600;
}
```

✅ **Named Constants:**

```java
private static final int ADULT_AGE = 18;
private static final int PASSING_SCORE = 75;
private static final int SESSION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 3600;

if (age >= ADULT_AGE && score > PASSING_SCORE) {
    timeout = SESSION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS;
}
```

**E. Break Long Functions into Smaller Pieces**

❌ **Long Function (hard to understand):**

```python
def process_order(order):
    # Validate order (20 lines)
    # Calculate prices (15 lines)
    # Apply discounts (25 lines)
    # Process payment (30 lines)
    # Send confirmation (10 lines)
    # Update inventory (15 lines)
```

✅ **Broken into Single-Responsibility Functions:**

```python
def process_order(order):
    validate_order(order)
    total = calculate_order_total(order)
    discounted_total = apply_discounts(order, total)
    payment_result = process_payment(order, discounted_total)
    send_confirmation_email(order, payment_result)
    update_inventory(order)
```

#### Performance Optimizations

**A. Improve Algorithm Efficiency**

❌ **Inefficient Algorithm (O(n²)):**

```javascript
function findDuplicates(arr) {
  const duplicates = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    for (let j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++) {
      if (arr[i] === arr[j] && !duplicates.includes(arr[i])) {
        duplicates.push(arr[i]);
      }
    }
  }
  return duplicates;
}
```

✅ **Optimized Algorithm (O(n)):**

```javascript
function findDuplicates(arr) {
  const seen = new Set();
  const duplicates = new Set();

  for (const item of arr) {
    if (seen.has(item)) {
      duplicates.add(item);
    } else {
      seen.add(item);
    }
  }

  return Array.from(duplicates);
}
```

**Performance Impact:** O(n²) → O(n), significant improvement for large arrays

**B. Optimize Data Structures**

❌ **Inefficient Data Structure:**

```python
# Checking membership in list is O(n)
allowed_users = ["alice", "bob", "charlie", ...]  # 10,000 users

if username in allowed_users:  # O(n) lookup
    grant_access()
```

✅ **Optimized Data Structure:**

```python
# Checking membership in set is O(1)
allowed_users = {"alice", "bob", "charlie", ...}  # 10,000 users

if username in allowed_users:  # O(1) lookup
    grant_access()
```

**Performance Impact:** O(n) → O(1) for lookups

**C. Cache Repeated Calculations**

❌ **Repeated Calculations:**

```python
def calculate_discount(items):
    total = sum(item.price for item in items)

    if sum(item.price for item in items) > 100:  # Calculated again
        discount = sum(item.price for item in items) * 0.1  # And again
        return sum(item.price for item in items) - discount  # And again
```

✅ **Cached Calculation:**

```python
def calculate_discount(items):
    total = sum(item.price for item in items)

    if total > 100:
        discount = total * 0.1
        return total - discount

    return total
```

**D. Reduce Unnecessary Operations**

❌ **Unnecessary Operations:**

```javascript
function processUsers(users) {
  // Creates intermediate arrays at each step
  return users
    .filter((user) => user.active)
    .map((user) => user.id)
    .filter((id) => id > 1000)
    .map((id) => ({ userId: id }));
}
```

✅ **Combined Operations:**

```javascript
function processUsers(users) {
  // Single pass through array
  return users.filter((user) => user.active && user.id > 1000).map((user) => ({ userId: user.id }));
}
```

### 3. Create Before/After Examples

Document each optimization with examples:

**Before/After Template:**

````markdown
## Optimization: [Name of Optimization]

### Before (Original Code)

```[language]
[original code with issues highlighted]
```
````

**Issues:**

- Issue 1: [description]
- Issue 2: [description]

### After (Optimized Code)

```[language]
[improved code with changes highlighted]
```

**Improvements:**

- Improvement 1: [description]
- Improvement 2: [description]

### Rationale

[Explain WHY this optimization was made, what tradeoffs were considered, and when this pattern should be used]

### Performance Impact (if applicable)

- **Before:** [benchmark results]
- **After:** [benchmark results]
- **Improvement:** [percentage or absolute improvement]

````

**Example:**

```markdown
## Optimization: Replace Nested Loops with Hash Set

### Before (Original Code)

```python
def find_common_elements(list1, list2):
    common = []
    for item1 in list1:  # O(n)
        for item2 in list2:  # O(m)
            if item1 == item2:
                common.append(item1)
    return common
````

**Issues:**

- Time complexity: O(n × m) - quadratic time
- Performance degrades significantly with large lists
- Duplicate handling not addressed

### After (Optimized Code)

```python
def find_common_elements(list1, list2):
    # Convert to set for O(1) lookups
    set2 = set(list2)

    # Single pass through list1
    common = []
    for item in list1:
        if item in set2:
            common.append(item)

    # Alternative: one-liner using set intersection
    # return list(set(list1) & set(list2))

    return common
```

**Improvements:**

- Time complexity: O(n + m) - linear time
- Scales well to large datasets
- Naturally handles duplicates via set

### Rationale

For finding common elements, set intersection is the optimal approach. We convert one list to a set (O(m)), then check membership for each element in the other list (O(n)). This is dramatically faster than nested loops for large datasets.

**Tradeoff:** Uses O(m) extra space for the set, but time savings justify space cost for most use cases.

**When to use:** Anytime you're checking if items from one collection exist in another collection.

### Performance Impact

**Benchmark:** 10,000 elements in each list

- **Before:** 2.47 seconds
- **After:** 0.003 seconds
- **Improvement:** 823x faster

````

### 4. Explain Rationale for Each Change

For every optimization, document:

**1. What Changed?**
- Specific lines/sections modified
- Nature of the change (algorithm, structure, naming, etc.)

**2. Why Was This Changed?**
- What problem did it solve?
- What was wrong with the original?
- What principle does this follow?

**3. When Should This Pattern Be Used?**
- In what situations is this optimization appropriate?
- When might the original approach be acceptable?
- Are there cases where this optimization would be wrong?

**4. What Are the Tradeoffs?**
- Does this use more memory?
- Is it more complex?
- Does it have edge cases?
- Is it less flexible?

### 5. Include Performance Benchmarks (If Applicable)

For performance optimizations, provide evidence:

**Benchmarking Approach:**

```python
import time

def benchmark(func, iterations=10000):
    start = time.time()
    for _ in range(iterations):
        func()
    end = time.time()
    return end - start

# Test both implementations
original_time = benchmark(original_function)
optimized_time = benchmark(optimized_function)

print(f"Original: {original_time:.4f}s")
print(f"Optimized: {optimized_time:.4f}s")
print(f"Improvement: {original_time / optimized_time:.2f}x faster")
````

**Benchmark Report Template:**

```markdown
### Performance Benchmarks

**Test Configuration:**

- Dataset Size: [size]
- Iterations: [count]
- Platform: [OS, CPU]
- Language Version: [version]

**Results:**

| Implementation | Time (ms) | Memory (MB) | Improvement |
| -------------- | --------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Original       | 2,470     | 12.5        | Baseline    |
| Optimized      | 3         | 18.2        | 823x faster |

**Analysis:**
The optimized version is 823x faster despite using 45% more memory. For technical book examples, this demonstrates the classic time-space tradeoff and is worth the memory cost.
```

### 6. Run Code-Quality Checklist

Execute checklist validation:

```bash
# Using execute-checklist.md task
execute-checklist code-quality-checklist.md
```

Ensure optimized code:

- [ ] Follows language-specific style guide
- [ ] Uses descriptive naming
- [ ] Has appropriate comments
- [ ] Is DRY (no repetition)
- [ ] Has proper error handling
- [ ] Is testable
- [ ] Is maintainable
- [ ] Demonstrates best practices

### 7. Generate Optimization Report

Create comprehensive optimization documentation:

**Optimization Report Template:**

```markdown
# Code Optimization Report: [Code Name]

**Optimization Date:** [date]
**Optimization Goal:** [clarity|performance|both]
**Target Audience:** [beginner|intermediate|advanced]
**Optimized By:** code-curator agent

## Summary

**Total Optimizations:** [count]

- Clarity Improvements: [count]
- Performance Improvements: [count]

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Over-optimization**: Don't sacrifice clarity for minor performance gains in teaching code
- **Premature optimization**: Focus on clarity first, performance second
- **Clever code**: Avoid "clever" tricks that confuse readers
- **Missing benchmarks**: Always measure before claiming performance improvements
- **Breaking functionality**: Ensure optimizations don't introduce bugs
- **Ignoring audience**: Beginner code should prioritize clarity over efficiency
- **No explanation**: Every optimization needs rationale documented
- **Incomplete testing**: Test optimized code thoroughly

## Optimization Priorities by Audience

### Beginner Audience

**Priority Order:**

1. **Clarity** (most important)
2. **Simplicity**
3. **Correctness**
4. **Performance** (least important, unless demonstrating concept)

**Guidelines:**

- Favor explicit over implicit
- Use longer, descriptive names
- Add more explanatory comments
- Prefer simple algorithms even if slower
- Break into smaller functions
- Avoid advanced language features

### Intermediate Audience

**Priority Order:**

1. **Clarity**
2. **Performance**
3. **Best Practices**
4. **Sophistication**

**Guidelines:**

- Balance clarity and efficiency
- Demonstrate idiomatic patterns
- Use appropriate language features
- Show common optimizations
- Explain tradeoffs

### Advanced Audience

**Priority Order:**

1. **Performance**
2. **Best Practices**
3. **Sophistication**
4. **Clarity** (still important, but audience can handle complexity)

**Guidelines:**

- Show production-quality code
- Demonstrate advanced patterns
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Use optimal algorithms and data structures
- Explain complex optimizations

## Optimization Pattern Catalog

Common optimization patterns for technical books:

### Pattern: Extract Method

**When:** Function > 20 lines or does multiple things

**Before:**

```python
def process_order(order):
    # 50 lines of validation, calculation, payment, email
```

**After:**

```python
def process_order(order):
    validate_order(order)
    total = calculate_total(order)
    charge_payment(order, total)
    send_confirmation(order)
```

### Pattern: Replace Loop with Built-in

**When:** Manual iteration can be replaced with language built-ins

**Before:**

```python
total = 0
for item in items:
    total += item.price
```

**After:**

```python
total = sum(item.price for item in items)
```

### Pattern: Early Return

**When:** Deep nesting can be flattened

**Before:**

```javascript
function processUser(user) {
  if (user) {
    if (user.active) {
      if (user.hasPermission) {
        // actual logic
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**After:**

```javascript
function processUser(user) {
  if (!user) return;
  if (!user.active) return;
  if (!user.hasPermission) return;

  // actual logic (not nested)
}
```

### Pattern: Use Descriptive Temporary Variables

**When:** Complex condition or calculation appears multiple times

**Before:**

```python
if user.age >= 18 and user.hasID and user.passedTest:
    # do something
elif user.age >= 18 and user.hasID:
    # do something else
```

**After:**

```python
is_adult = user.age >= 18
has_identification = user.hasID
passed_exam = user.passedTest
is_fully_qualified = is_adult and has_identification and passed_exam

if is_fully_qualified:
    # do something
elif is_adult and has_identification:
    # do something else
```

## Profiling Tools by Language

Use these tools to identify performance bottlenecks:

**Python:**

- cProfile (built-in profiler)
- line_profiler (line-by-line timing)
- memory_profiler (memory usage)

**JavaScript/Node:**

- Chrome DevTools Profiler
- Node.js --prof flag
- clinic.js (performance diagnostics)

**Java:**

- JProfiler
- VisualVM
- Java Flight Recorder

**Go:**

- pprof (built-in profiler)
- go tool trace

**Ruby:**

- ruby-prof
- stackprof

## Next Steps

After code optimization:

1. Review optimizations with technical expert
2. Update code repository with optimized versions
3. Integrate optimization explanations into chapter narrative
4. Create "Optimization Spotlight" sidebars for key patterns
5. Design exercises where readers apply optimization patterns
6. Add performance comparison diagrams if significant improvements
7. Update code examples in documentation

output: docs/troubleshooting/{{issue-name}}-troubleshooting-guide.md

---

## Purpose

This task helps create comprehensive troubleshooting guides for technical book readers. When code examples fail, readers need clear diagnostic steps and solutions. Good troubleshooting documentation anticipates common issues, explains root causes, provides actionable fixes, and helps readers learn debugging skills.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this task:

- Code example exists (working or broken)
- Error description or problem statement available
- Programming language identified
- Access to testing environment matching reader setup
- Understanding of common reader pain points

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Parse Error Message or Problem Description

Analyze the error/problem thoroughly:

**Error Message Analysis:**

Extract key information:

- **Error type**: What kind of error? (SyntaxError, RuntimeError, ImportError, etc.)
- **Error message**: Exact text of the error
- **Stack trace**: Where did the error occur? (file, line number, function)
- **Context**: What was the code trying to do?

**Example - Python Error:**

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "example.py", line 12, in <module>
    result = process_data(input_file)
  File "example.py", line 7, in process_data
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'data.txt'
```

**Extracted Information:**

- **Error Type**: FileNotFoundError
- **Error Message**: "No such file or directory: 'data.txt'"
- **Location**: Line 7, in `process_data()` function
- **Context**: Attempting to open a file for reading

**Problem Description Analysis (No Error Yet):**

If no error message exists, identify the symptom:

- What behavior is unexpected?
- What was expected to happen?
- What actually happened?
- When does the issue occur?

### 2. Identify Error Type

Categorize the error:

#### Syntax Errors

Code violates language grammar rules.

**Characteristics:**

- Detected before execution
- Prevents code from running
- Usually has clear error location

**Examples:**

```python
# Python - Missing colon
if x > 10
    print("Large")

# SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

```javascript
// JavaScript - Missing closing brace
function greet(name) {
    console.log("Hello " + name);
// SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input
```

#### Runtime Errors

Code is syntactically valid but fails during execution.

**Characteristics:**

- Occurs while program is running
- Often caused by invalid operations or missing resources
- May be intermittent

**Examples:**

```python
# Python - Division by zero
result = 10 / 0
# ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
```

```javascript
// JavaScript - Null reference
let user = null;
console.log(user.name);
// TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of null
```

#### Logic Errors

Code runs without errors but produces wrong results.

**Characteristics:**

- No error message
- Code executes completely
- Output is incorrect or unexpected
- Hardest to debug

**Examples:**

```python
# Python - Off-by-one error
def get_last_item(items):
    return items[len(items)]  # Should be len(items) - 1
# IndexError: list index out of range
```

#### Environment Errors

Code works in one environment but fails in another.

**Characteristics:**

- Platform-specific (Windows/Mac/Linux)
- Version-specific (Python 3.9 vs 3.11)
- Configuration-dependent (missing env vars)
- Dependency-related (wrong package version)

**Examples:**

```python
# Module not found - dependency not installed
import numpy as np
# ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'
```

### 3. Determine Root Cause Category

Classify the underlying cause:

**Common Root Cause Categories:**

| Category                    | Description                                     | Common Symptoms                        |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Missing Dependency**      | Required package/module not installed           | ImportError, ModuleNotFoundError       |
| **File/Path Issues**        | File doesn't exist, wrong path, wrong directory | FileNotFoundError, ENOENT              |
| **Version Incompatibility** | Code uses features from newer version           | SyntaxError, AttributeError            |
| **Platform Differences**    | OS-specific path separators, commands           | FileNotFoundError, command not found   |
| **Configuration Missing**   | Environment variables, config files not set     | KeyError, ValueError                   |
| **Typo/Copy Error**         | Reader mistyped code from book                  | SyntaxError, NameError                 |
| **Permissions**             | Insufficient file/directory permissions         | PermissionError, EACCES                |
| **Port/Resource Conflict**  | Port already in use, resource locked            | Address already in use, EADDRINUSE     |
| **API Changes**             | Library API changed between versions            | AttributeError, TypeError              |
| **Encoding Issues**         | Character encoding mismatches                   | UnicodeDecodeError, UnicodeEncodeError |

### 4. Research Common Patterns

Identify if this is a known common issue:

**Build Knowledge Base Entry:**

```markdown
### Common Issue Pattern: [Pattern Name]

**Frequency:** [Common|Occasional|Rare]

**Typical Error Message:**
```

[exact error text or pattern]

```

**Common Causes:**
1. [Cause 1]
2. [Cause 2]
3. [Cause 3]

**Quick Diagnosis:**
- Check [specific thing]
- Verify [specific condition]
- Test [specific scenario]

**Standard Solution:**
[step-by-step fix]

**Prevention:**
[how to avoid in future]
```

**Example Pattern:**

```markdown
### Common Issue Pattern: Module Not Found in Python

**Frequency:** Very Common (especially for beginners)

**Typical Error Message:**
```

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'package_name'
ImportError: No module named 'package_name'

```

**Common Causes:**
1. Package not installed
2. Wrong virtual environment active
3. Package installed for different Python version
4. Typo in package name

**Quick Diagnosis:**
- Run: `pip list | grep package_name`
- Check: `which python` and `which pip`
- Verify: Virtual environment is activated

**Standard Solution:**
1. Activate correct virtual environment
2. Install package: `pip install package_name`
3. Verify: `pip show package_name`

**Prevention:**
- Document all dependencies in `requirements.txt`
- Include setup instructions in README
- Remind readers to activate virtual environment
```

### 5. Develop Step-by-Step Diagnostic Workflow

Create systematic debugging process:

**Diagnostic Workflow Template:**

```markdown
## Debugging Workflow for [Error Name]

### Step 1: Verify the Error

**Action:** Reproduce the error to confirm the issue.

**How to reproduce:**

1. [Exact steps to trigger error]
2. [Expected vs actual behavior]

**What to look for:**

- [Specific error message]
- [Error location]

### Step 2: Check Common Causes

**Action:** Rule out the most frequent causes first.

**Common Cause 1: [Name]**

- **Check:** [What to verify]
- **Command:** `[diagnostic command]`
- **Expected Output:** [What success looks like]
- **If Failed:** [What this means]

**Common Cause 2: [Name]**
[Same structure]

### Step 3: Isolate the Issue

**Action:** Narrow down the exact source.

**Test 1:**

- **Try:** [Specific test]
- **If Succeeds:** [Conclusion]
- **If Fails:** [Next step]

### Step 4: Apply Solution

**Action:** Fix the identified issue.

**Solution:** [Detailed fix with code/commands]

### Step 5: Verify Fix

**Action:** Confirm the issue is resolved.

**Verification:**

1. [Test step 1]
2. [Test step 2]
3. [Expected successful outcome]
```

**Example Workflow:**

```markdown
## Debugging Workflow for FileNotFoundError

### Step 1: Verify the Error

**Action:** Confirm the file path and error message.

**How to reproduce:**

1. Run the code: `python example.py`
2. Observe the error message

**What to look for:**
```

FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'data.txt'

````

### Step 2: Check Common Causes

**Common Cause 1: Wrong Working Directory**
- **Check:** Current directory
- **Command:** `pwd` (Mac/Linux) or `cd` (Windows)
- **Expected:** Should be in the project directory
- **If Failed:** You're in the wrong directory

**Common Cause 2: File Doesn't Exist**
- **Check:** File exists in expected location
- **Command:** `ls data.txt` (Mac/Linux) or `dir data.txt` (Windows)
- **Expected:** File should be listed
- **If Failed:** File is missing or misnamed

**Common Cause 3: Typo in Filename**
- **Check:** Filename spelling and capitalization
- **Command:** `ls -la` to see all files
- **Expected:** Exact filename match (case-sensitive on Mac/Linux)
- **If Failed:** Fix filename in code or rename file

### Step 3: Isolate the Issue

**Test 1: Check if file exists anywhere in project**
- **Try:** `find . -name "data.txt"` (Mac/Linux) or `dir /s data.txt` (Windows)
- **If Succeeds:** File exists but in wrong location
- **If Fails:** File is completely missing

### Step 4: Apply Solution

**Solution A: File exists in wrong location**
```python
# Change path to correct location
with open('data/data.txt', 'r') as f:  # Add 'data/' prefix
    content = f.read()
````

**Solution B: File is missing**

1. Create the file: `touch data.txt` or create via editor
2. Add sample content
3. Verify: `ls -la data.txt`

**Solution C: Use absolute path (debugging only)**

```python
import os

# Print current directory
print(f"Current directory: {os.getcwd()}")

# Use absolute path temporarily
data_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'data', 'data.txt')
with open(data_path, 'r') as f:
    content = f.read()
```

### Step 5: Verify Fix

**Verification:**

1. Run code: `python example.py`
2. Should execute without FileNotFoundError
3. Check output is correct

````

### 6. Create Detailed Solution

Provide complete, actionable fix:

**Solution Template:**

### How to Avoid FileNotFoundError

1. **Use Absolute Paths for Critical Files**
   - Convert relative to absolute: `os.path.abspath('data.txt')`
   - Why: Eliminates ambiguity about file location

2. **Check File Exists Before Opening**

   ```python
   import os

   if os.path.exists('data.txt'):
       with open('data.txt', 'r') as f:
           content = f.read()
   else:
       print("Error: data.txt not found")
   ```
````

- Why: Provides better error message

3. **Document File Dependencies**
   - Create README with file structure
   - List all required files and their locations
   - Why: Helps readers set up correctly

### Best Practices

- ✅ **DO:** Include setup instructions with exact file locations
- ✅ **DO:** Provide sample data files in code repository
- ✅ **DO:** Use `os.path.join()` for cross-platform paths
- ❌ **DON'T:** Assume readers will create files from scratch
- ❌ **DON'T:** Use hardcoded absolute paths (not portable)
- ❌ **DON'T:** Rely on specific directory structure without documentation

### Checklist for Future Code Examples

- [ ] All required files listed in README
- [ ] Sample data files included in repository
- [ ] Paths are relative to project root
- [ ] File existence checks included (where appropriate)
- [ ] Error messages are reader-friendly

````

### 8. Document Platform-Specific Considerations

Address cross-platform issues:

**Platform Issues to Document:**

| Issue | Windows | Mac/Linux | Solution |
|-------|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Path Separators** | Backslash `\` | Forward slash `/` | Use `os.path.join()` |
| **Line Endings** | CRLF (`\r\n`) | LF (`\n`) | Open files with `newline` param |
| **Case Sensitivity** | Case-insensitive | Case-sensitive | Document exact casing |
| **Environment Variables** | `%VAR%` | `$VAR` | Use `os.getenv()` |
| **Shell Commands** | PowerShell/CMD | Bash | Provide both versions |
| **Executables** | `.exe` extension | No extension | Use `sys.executable` |

**Example Platform Documentation:**

```markdown
## Platform-Specific Notes

### File Paths

**Issue:** Path separators differ between platforms.

**Windows:**
```python
path = "data\\files\\example.txt"  # Backslashes
````

**Mac/Linux:**

```python
path = "data/files/example.txt"  # Forward slashes
```

**Cross-Platform Solution:**

```python
import os
path = os.path.join("data", "files", "example.txt")
# Automatically uses correct separator
```

### Running Commands

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
python example.py
Set-Item -Path env:API_KEY -Value "your_key"
```

**Windows (CMD):**

```cmd
python example.py
set API_KEY=your_key
```

**Mac/Linux:**

```bash
python3 example.py
export API_KEY="your_key"
```

````

# Code Style Guides for Technical Writing

This document summarizes language-specific coding standards for technical book code examples.

## Universal Code Example Standards

These apply to ALL code examples regardless of language:

### Readability First

- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Add inline comments for WHY, not WHAT
- Keep functions focused and small

### Educational Code vs Production Code

Technical book code should prioritize:

- **Clarity** over performance (unless teaching performance)
- **Explicitness** over brevity
- **Simplicity** over DRY (some repetition acceptable for clarity)
- **Readability** over advanced language features

### Comments

```
❌ Bad: Obvious comments
// increment counter
counter++;

✅ Good: Explain decisions
// Use exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming API during retry
await sleep(Math.pow(2, retryCount) * 1000);
```

### Error Handling

- Always demonstrate proper error handling
- Show common error scenarios
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Use language-appropriate patterns

### Magic Numbers

```
❌ Bad
if (age >= 18) { ... }

✅ Good
const MINIMUM_AGE = 18;
if (age >= MINIMUM_AGE) { ... }
```

---

## Python (PEP 8)

**Official Style Guide:** PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code

### Key Principles

**Indentation:**

- Use 4 spaces (not tabs)
- No mixing tabs and spaces

**Line Length:**

- Maximum 79 characters for code
- Maximum 72 for comments and docstrings

**Naming Conventions:**

```python
# Variables and functions: snake_case
user_name = "Alice"
def calculate_total(items): ...

# Constants: UPPER_CASE
MAX_CONNECTIONS = 100
API_TIMEOUT = 30

# Classes: PascalCase
class UserAccount: ...
class DatabaseConnection: ...

# Private: leading underscore
_internal_variable = 42
def _private_method(self): ...
```

**Imports:**

```python
# Standard library first
import os

**Docstrings:**

```python
def fetch_user(user_id: int) -> dict:
    """
    Fetch user data from the database.

    Args:
        user_id: The unique identifier for the user

## JavaScript (Airbnb Style Guide)

**Official Style Guide:** Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide (github.com/airbnb/javascript)

### Key Principles

**Variables:**

```javascript
// Use const for values that won't be reassigned
const API_URL = 'https://api.example.com';
const user = { name: 'Alice' };

// Use let for values that will change
let counter = 0;

// Never use var
var oldStyle = 'bad'; // ❌
```

**Naming Conventions:**

```javascript
// Variables and functions: camelCase
const userName = "Alice";
function calculateTotal(items) { ... }

// Constants: UPPER_CASE (by convention)
const MAX_RETRY_COUNT = 3;
const API_TIMEOUT = 30000;

// Classes: PascalCase
class UserAccount { ... }
class DatabaseConnection { ... }

// Private (by convention): leading underscore
class Example {
  _privateMethod() { ... }
}
```

**Functions:**

```javascript
// Arrow functions for callbacks
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const doubled = numbers.map((n) => n * 2);

// Named functions for clarity
function processOrder(order) {
  // Implementation
}

// Avoid function hoisting confusion
// Declare before use
const helper = () => { ... };
helper();
```

**Strings:**

```javascript
// Use template literals for interpolation
const message = `Hello, ${userName}!`; // ✅ Good
const bad = 'Hello, ' + userName + '!'; // ❌ Avoid

// Use single quotes for simple strings
const apiKey = 'abc123';
```

**Objects and Arrays:**

```javascript
// Use shorthand
const name = 'Alice';
const user = { name }; // ✅ Good (shorthand)
const user2 = { name: name }; // ❌ Verbose

// Destructuring
const { id, email } = user;
const [first, second] = array;

// Spread operator
const newUser = { ...user, status: 'active' };
const newArray = [...oldArray, newItem];
```

## Java (Google Style Guide)

**Official Style Guide:** Google Java Style Guide

### Key Principles

**Indentation:**

- Use 2 spaces (not 4, not tabs)
- Continuation indent: 4 spaces

**Naming Conventions:**

```java
// Classes: PascalCase
public class UserAccount { }
public class DatabaseConnection { }

// Methods and variables: camelCase
public void calculateTotal() { }
private int userCount = 0;

// Constants: UPPER_CASE
private static final int MAX_CONNECTIONS = 100;
public static final String API_URL = "https://api.example.com";

// Packages: lowercase
package com.example.myapp;
```

**Braces:**

```java
// Braces on same line (K&R style)
if (condition) {
  // code
} else {
  // code
}

// Always use braces, even for single statements
if (condition) {
  doSomething();  // ✅ Good
}

if (condition)
  doSomething();  // ❌ Bad (no braces)
```

**Javadoc:**

```java
/**
 * Fetches user data from the database.
 *
 * @param userId the unique identifier for the user
 * @return User object containing user data
 * @throws UserNotFoundException if user doesn't exist
 */
public User fetchUser(int userId) throws UserNotFoundException {
  // Implementation
}
```

**Ordering:**

```java
public class Example {
  // 1. Static fields
  private static final int CONSTANT = 42;

  // 2. Instance fields
  private int count;

  // 3. Constructor
  public Example() { }

  // 4. Public methods
  public void doSomething() { }

  // 5. Private methods
  private void helper() { }
}
```

## Code Example Best Practices by Language

### Python

```python
# ✅ Good Example
def authenticate_user(username: str, password: str) -> dict:
    """
    Authenticate user and return JWT token.

    Args:
        username: User's login name
        password: User's password (will be hashed)

    Returns:
        Dictionary with 'token' and 'expires_at' keys

    Raises:
        AuthenticationError: If credentials are invalid
    """
    # Hash password for comparison
    password_hash = hash_password(password)

    # Query database
    user = User.query.filter_by(username=username).first()

    if not user or user.password_hash != password_hash:
        raise AuthenticationError("Invalid credentials")

    # Generate JWT token with 1-hour expiration
    token = jwt.encode(
        {"user_id": user.id, "exp": datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(hours=1)},
        SECRET_KEY,
        algorithm="HS256",
    )

    return {"token": token, "expires_at": datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(hours=1)}
```

### JavaScript/Node.js

```javascript
// ✅ Good Example
async function authenticateUser(username, password) {
  // Hash password for comparison
  const passwordHash = await bcrypt.hash(password, SALT_ROUNDS);

  // Query database
  const user = await User.findOne({ where: { username } });

  if (!user || !(await bcrypt.compare(password, user.passwordHash))) {
    throw new AuthenticationError('Invalid credentials');
  }

  // Generate JWT token with 1-hour expiration
  const token = jwt.sign({ userId: user.id }, SECRET_KEY, { expiresIn: '1h' });

  return {
    token,
    expiresAt: new Date(Date.now() + 3600000), // 1 hour from now
  };
}
```

### Java

```java
// ✅ Good Example
public class AuthService {
  private static final int TOKEN_EXPIRY_HOURS = 1;

  /**
   * Authenticates user and returns JWT token.
   *
   * @param username user's login name
   * @param password user's password (will be hashed)
   * @return AuthResponse containing token and expiration
   * @throws AuthenticationException if credentials are invalid
   */
  public AuthResponse authenticateUser(String username, String password)
      throws AuthenticationException {
    // Hash password for comparison
    String passwordHash = PasswordUtil.hash(password);

    // Query database
    User user = userRepository.findByUsername(username);

    if (user == null || !user.getPasswordHash().equals(passwordHash)) {
      throw new AuthenticationException("Invalid credentials");
    }

    // Generate JWT token with 1-hour expiration
    String token = Jwts.builder()
        .setSubject(String.valueOf(user.getId()))
        .setExpiration(new Date(System.currentTimeMillis() + TimeUnit.HOURS.toMillis(TOKEN_EXPIRY_HOURS)))
        .signWith(SignatureAlgorithm.HS256, SECRET_KEY)
        .compact();

    return new AuthResponse(token, new Date(System.currentTimeMillis() + TimeUnit.HOURS.toMillis(TOKEN_EXPIRY_HOURS)));
  }
}
```

## Testing Code Examples

For technical books, include test examples:

### Python (pytest)

```python
def test_authenticate_user_success():
    """Test successful authentication."""
    response = authenticate_user("alice", "correct_password")
    assert "token" in response
    assert response["expires_at"] > datetime.utcnow()


def test_authenticate_user_invalid_password():
    """Test authentication with wrong password."""
    with pytest.raises(AuthenticationError):
        authenticate_user("alice", "wrong_password")
```

### JavaScript (Jest)

```javascript
describe('authenticateUser', () => {
  it('returns token for valid credentials', async () => {
    const response = await authenticateUser('alice', 'correct_password');
    expect(response).toHaveProperty('token');
    expect(response.expiresAt).toBeInstanceOf(Date);
  });

  it('throws error for invalid password', async () => {
    await expect(authenticateUser('alice', 'wrong_password')).rejects.toThrow(AuthenticationError);
  });
});
```
