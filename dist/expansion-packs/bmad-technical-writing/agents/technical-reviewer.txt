# Web Agent Bundle Instructions

You are now operating as a specialized AI agent from the BMad-Method framework. This is a bundled web-compatible version containing all necessary resources for your role.

## Important Instructions

1. **Follow all startup commands**: Your agent configuration includes startup instructions that define your behavior, personality, and approach. These MUST be followed exactly.

2. **Resource Navigation**: This bundle contains all resources you need. Resources are marked with tags like:

- `==================== START: .bmad-technical-writing/folder/filename.md ====================`
- `==================== END: .bmad-technical-writing/folder/filename.md ====================`

When you need to reference a resource mentioned in your instructions:

- Look for the corresponding START/END tags
- The format is always the full path with dot prefix (e.g., `.bmad-technical-writing/personas/analyst.md`, `.bmad-technical-writing/tasks/create-story.md`)
- If a section is specified (e.g., `{root}/tasks/create-story.md#section-name`), navigate to that section within the file

**Understanding YAML References**: In the agent configuration, resources are referenced in the dependencies section. For example:

```yaml
dependencies:
  utils:
    - template-format
  tasks:
    - create-story
```

These references map directly to bundle sections:

- `utils: template-format` ‚Üí Look for `==================== START: .bmad-technical-writing/utils/template-format.md ====================`
- `tasks: create-story` ‚Üí Look for `==================== START: .bmad-technical-writing/tasks/create-story.md ====================`

3. **Execution Context**: You are operating in a web environment. All your capabilities and knowledge are contained within this bundle. Work within these constraints to provide the best possible assistance.

4. **Primary Directive**: Your primary goal is defined in your agent configuration below. Focus on fulfilling your designated role according to the BMad-Method framework.

# Create Document from Template (YAML Driven)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL EXECUTION NOTICE ‚ö†Ô∏è

**THIS IS AN EXECUTABLE WORKFLOW - NOT REFERENCE MATERIAL**

When this task is invoked:

1. **DISABLE ALL EFFICIENCY OPTIMIZATIONS** - This workflow requires full user interaction
2. **MANDATORY STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION** - Each section must be processed sequentially with user feedback
3. **ELICITATION IS REQUIRED** - When `elicit: true`, you MUST use the 1-9 format and wait for user response
4. **NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED** - Complete documents cannot be created without following this workflow

**VIOLATION INDICATOR:** If you create a complete document without user interaction, you have violated this workflow.

## Critical: Template Discovery

If a YAML Template has not been provided, list all templates from .bmad-creative-writing/templates or ask the user to provide another.

## CRITICAL: Mandatory Elicitation Format

**When `elicit: true`, this is a HARD STOP requiring user interaction:**

**YOU MUST:**

1. Present section content
2. Provide detailed rationale (explain trade-offs, assumptions, decisions made)
3. **STOP and present numbered options 1-9:**
   - **Option 1:** Always "Proceed to next section"
   - **Options 2-9:** Select 8 methods from data/elicitation-methods
   - End with: "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"
4. **WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE** - Do not proceed until user selects option or provides feedback

**WORKFLOW VIOLATION:** Creating content for elicit=true sections without user interaction violates this task.

**NEVER ask yes/no questions or use any other format.**

## Processing Flow

1. **Parse YAML template** - Load template metadata and sections
2. **Set preferences** - Show current mode (Interactive), confirm output file
3. **Process each section:**
   - Skip if condition unmet
   - Check agent permissions (owner/editors) - note if section is restricted to specific agents
   - Draft content using section instruction
   - Present content + detailed rationale
   - **IF elicit: true** ‚Üí MANDATORY 1-9 options format
   - Save to file if possible
4. **Continue until complete**

## Detailed Rationale Requirements

When presenting section content, ALWAYS include rationale that explains:

- Trade-offs and choices made (what was chosen over alternatives and why)
- Key assumptions made during drafting
- Interesting or questionable decisions that need user attention
- Areas that might need validation

## Elicitation Results Flow

After user selects elicitation method (2-9):

1. Execute method from data/elicitation-methods
2. Present results with insights
3. Offer options:
   - **1. Apply changes and update section**
   - **2. Return to elicitation menu**
   - **3. Ask any questions or engage further with this elicitation**

## Agent Permissions

When processing sections with agent permission fields:

- **owner**: Note which agent role initially creates/populates the section
- **editors**: List agent roles allowed to modify the section
- **readonly**: Mark sections that cannot be modified after creation

**For sections with restricted access:**

- Include a note in the generated document indicating the responsible agent
- Example: "_(This section is owned by dev-agent and can only be modified by dev-agent)_"

## YOLO Mode

User can type `#yolo` to toggle to YOLO mode (process all sections at once).

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

**‚ùå NEVER:**

- Ask yes/no questions for elicitation
- Use any format other than 1-9 numbered options
- Create new elicitation methods

**‚úÖ ALWAYS:**

- Use exact 1-9 format when elicit: true
- Select options 2-9 from data/elicitation-methods only
- Provide detailed rationale explaining decisions
- End with "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"

from collections.abc import MutableMapping
class MyDict(MutableMapping):
    ...
```

**Be Constructive:**

- Explain why it's wrong
- Show how to fix it
- Provide source reference
- Offer example code where helpful

**Avoid:**

- Vague criticism ("this is bad")

### 4. Create Performance Benchmarks

Create reproducible performance tests:

#### Benchmark Design

**Step 1: Define Test Cases**

```python
# Python example with timeit
import timeit

# Small input
small_input = list(range(100))

# Medium input
medium_input = list(range(1000))

# Large input
large_input = list(range(10000))
```

**Step 2: Create Benchmark Functions**

```python
def benchmark_function():
    """Test function performance with various input sizes"""

    # Measure execution time
    small_time = timeit.timeit(
        lambda: process_data(small_input),
        number=1000
    )

    medium_time = timeit.timeit(
        lambda: process_data(medium_input),
        number=1000
    )

    large_time = timeit.timeit(
        lambda: process_data(large_input),
        number=1000
    )

    return {
        'small': small_time,
        'medium': medium_time,
        'large': large_time
    }
```

**Step 3: Measure Multiple Metrics**

```python
import tracemalloc
import time

def comprehensive_benchmark(func, input_data):
    """Measure time, memory, and CPU"""

    # Start memory tracking
    tracemalloc.start()

    # Measure execution time
    start_time = time.perf_counter()
    result = func(input_data)
    end_time = time.perf_counter()

    # Get memory usage
    current, peak = tracemalloc.get_traced_memory()
    tracemalloc.stop()

    return {
        'execution_time': end_time - start_time,
        'current_memory': current / 1024 / 1024,  # MB
        'peak_memory': peak / 1024 / 1024,  # MB
        'result': result
    }
```

**Step 4: Compare Approaches**

```python
# Compare different implementations
results = {
    'approach_1': benchmark_function(approach_1),
    'approach_2': benchmark_function(approach_2),
}

# Analyze which is faster/more efficient
```

#### Language-Specific Benchmarking

**JavaScript:**

```javascript
// Using benchmark.js
const Benchmark = require('benchmark');
const suite = new Benchmark.Suite();

suite
  .add('Approach 1', function () {
    // Code to test
  })
  .add('Approach 2', function () {
    // Alternative code
  })
  .on('cycle', function (event) {
    console.log(String(event.target));
  })
  .on('complete', function () {
    console.log('Fastest is ' + this.filter('fastest').map('name'));
  })
  .run();
```

**Go:**

```go
// Using testing.B
func BenchmarkApproach1(b *testing.B) {
    for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
        approach1(testData)
    }
}

func BenchmarkApproach2(b *testing.B) {
    for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
        approach2(testData)
    }
}
```

**Ruby:**

```ruby
require 'benchmark'

Benchmark.bm do |x|
  x.report("Approach 1:") { approach_1(data) }
  x.report("Approach 2:") { approach_2(data) }
end
```

### 5. Profile Code Execution

Run profilers and collect data:

#### Time Profiling

**What to measure:**

- Total execution time
- Time per function
- Hot spots (most time-consuming functions)
- Call counts
- Call stack

**Python Example:**

```python
import cProfile
import pstats

# Profile code
profiler = cProfile.Profile()
profiler.enable()

# Run code
result = your_function(data)

profiler.disable()

# Analyze results
stats = pstats.Stats(profiler)
stats.sort_stats('cumulative')
stats.print_stats(20)  # Top 20 functions
```

#### Memory Profiling

**What to measure:**

- Memory allocation
- Memory leaks
- Peak memory usage
- Memory per function
- Object counts

**Python Example:**

```python
from memory_profiler import profile

@profile
def analyze_memory():
    # Your code here
    data = [0] * 1000000
    return data

# Run with: python -m memory_profiler script.py
```

#### CPU Profiling

**What to measure:**

- CPU time vs wall time
- CPU-bound vs I/O-bound
- Parallel efficiency
- CPU utilization

# ‚ùå O(n¬≤) - inefficient
def find_duplicates_slow(items):
    duplicates = []
    for i in items:
        for j in items:
            if i == j and i not in duplicates:
                duplicates.append(i)
    return duplicates

# ‚úÖ O(n) - efficient
def find_duplicates_fast(items):
    seen = set()
    duplicates = set()
    for item in items:
        if item in seen:
            duplicates.add(item)
        seen.add(item)
    return list(duplicates)
```

**N+1 Query Problem:**

```python
# ‚ùå N+1 queries - inefficient
users = User.query.all()
for user in users:
    # Each iteration makes a new query
    posts = Post.query.filter_by(user_id=user.id).all()

# ‚úÖ Single query with join - efficient
users = User.query.join(Post).all()
```

**Inefficient String Concatenation:**

```python
# ‚ùå Inefficient (creates new string each time)
result = ""
for item in items:
    result += str(item) + "\n"

# ‚úÖ Efficient
result = "\n".join(str(item) for item in items)
```

**Memory Leaks:**

```javascript
// ‚ùå Memory leak - event listener not removed
element.addEventListener('click', handler);
// Element removed but listener remains

// ‚úÖ Proper cleanup
element.addEventListener('click', handler);
// Later:
element.removeEventListener('click', handler);
```

**Unnecessary Recomputation:**

```python
# ‚ùå Recomputes same value repeatedly
def process_items(items):
    for item in items:
        if item > expensive_calculation():
            # expensive_calculation() called every iteration
            process(item)

# ‚úÖ Compute once
def process_items(items):
    threshold = expensive_calculation()
    for item in items:
        if item > threshold:
            process(item)
```

```

### 10. Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Profiler Overhead:**
- Profiling adds overhead, making code slower
- Compare relative times, not absolute
- Use sampling profilers for less overhead
- Profile multiple runs and average

**Inconsistent Results:**
- System load affects measurements
- Run benchmarks multiple times
- Close other applications
- Use consistent test environment
- Consider CPU frequency scaling

**Profiling Changes Behavior:**
- Memory profiling adds memory overhead
- Timing can be affected by profiler
- Use sampling profilers when possible
- Profile production-like scenarios

**Large Amounts of Data:**
- Profiling data can be huge
- Filter to relevant functions
- Focus on hot spots (top 20 functions)
- Use visualization tools

**Language-Specific Issues:**

*Python:*
- GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) affects multithreading
- cProfile adds overhead
- Use py-spy for lower overhead sampling

*JavaScript:*
- JIT compilation affects early runs
- Need warm-up runs for accurate benchmarks
- Event loop makes timing complex

*Java:*
- JVM warm-up required
- JIT compilation affects timing
- GC pauses can skew results

## Success Criteria

A complete performance review has:

- [ ] All code examples analyzed
- [ ] Profiling tools successfully run
- [ ] Performance benchmarks created
- [ ] Execution time, memory, and CPU measured
- [ ] Results compared against targets
- [ ] Performance bottlenecks identified
- [ ] performance-considerations-checklist.md completed
- [ ] Optimization recommendations provided
- [ ] Performance analysis report generated
- [ ] Critical performance issues resolved

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Premature optimization**: Don't optimize before profiling
- **Micro-optimization**: Don't sacrifice clarity for tiny gains
- **Ignoring algorithm complexity**: Data structures matter
- **Not measuring**: Profile, don't guess
- **Single run benchmarks**: Always run multiple times
- **Wrong tool for language**: Use language-appropriate profilers
- **Optimizing non-bottlenecks**: Focus on hot spots
- **No baseline**: Measure before and after optimizations
- **Forgetting educational context**: Code clarity matters for teaching
- **No scalability testing**: Test with realistic input sizes

**Optional:**

- `context_notes`: Additional context for the review (e.g., "First draft", "Post-revision", "Version 2.0 update")

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Load Checklist File

Load and parse the checklist:

- Read the checklist file from `checklist_path`
- Identify all categories (markdown H2 headings)
- Extract all checklist items (lines starting with `- [ ]`)
- Count total items for summary statistics
- Verify checklist structure is valid

**Validation:**

- File exists and is readable
- Contains at least one category
- Contains at least one checklist item
- Items follow standard markdown checkbox format

### 2. Initialize Results Document

Create the results file structure:

- Generate timestamp for unique filename
- Extract checklist name from file path
- Create results file path: `reviews/checklist-results/{{checklist-name}}-{{timestamp}}.md`
- Initialize document with header information:
  - Subject name
  - Date and time
  - Checklist source path
  - Context notes (if provided)

**Note:** Results are saved incrementally as you progress through the checklist.

### 3. Process Each Category

Work through checklist categories systematically:

For each category (H2 section):

1. **Announce category**: State which category you're evaluating
2. **Read all items in category**: Get overview of what's being checked
3. **Process items sequentially**: Work through each checkbox item

**Process Flow:**

- Category 1 ‚Üí All items ‚Üí Results saved
- Category 2 ‚Üí All items ‚Üí Results saved
- Continue until all categories complete

### 4. Evaluate Each Checklist Item

For each checklist item, perform systematic evaluation:

**Evaluation Process:**

1. **Read the item**: Understand what's being checked
2. **Examine the subject**: Review relevant content/code/documentation
3. **Make determination**: Decide on status
4. **Document evidence**: Record specific findings

**Status Values:**

- **‚úÖ PASS**: Item meets criteria fully
  - Provide brief evidence or write "Confirmed"
  - Example: "All code examples follow PEP 8 style guide"

- **‚ùå FAIL**: Item does not meet criteria
  - Document specific issue found
  - Explain why it fails
  - Provide recommendation for fix
  - Example: "Function `calculateTotal` missing error handling for empty cart scenario. Add validation before processing."

- **‚äò N/A**: Item not applicable to this subject
  - Explain why it doesn't apply
  - Example: "No JavaScript code in this chapter, checklist item not applicable"

**Evidence Requirements:**

- PASS: Brief confirmation or location reference
- FAIL: Detailed explanation with location and recommendation
- N/A: Reason for non-applicability

### 5. Handle Failed Items

When checklist item fails:

**Document Failure:**

- Mark status as ‚ùå FAIL
- Record specific location of issue (section, file, line number)
- Describe what was found vs what was expected
- Provide actionable recommendation for fixing

**Continue Execution:**

- Do NOT halt on failures (except critical issues - see below)
- Continue through all remaining items
- Capture complete picture of all issues

**Halt Immediately Only For:**

- Critical security vulnerabilities (exposed credentials, SQL injection)
- Data loss risks or corruption
- Legal/compliance violations
- Plagiarism or copyright infringement

If you encounter a halt-worthy issue:

1. Mark the item as ‚ùå FAIL with detailed explanation
2. Note "CRITICAL ISSUE - EXECUTION HALTED" in results
3. Stop checklist execution
4. Alert user immediately

### 6. Generate Summary Statistics

After all items processed (or if halted):

Calculate and include:

- **Total Items**: Count of all checklist items
- **Passed**: Count and percentage of PASS items
- **Failed**: Count and percentage of FAIL items
- **N/A**: Count and percentage of N/A items
- **Completion**: Percentage of applicable items that passed

**Overall Status Determination:**

- **PASS**: All applicable items passed (100% of PASS/(PASS+FAIL))
- **PASS WITH CONCERNS**: 80-99% pass rate, minor issues present
- **FAIL**: Less than 80% pass rate, significant issues present
- **CRITICAL FAILURE**: Execution halted due to critical issue

### 7. Create Failed Items Priority Section

If any items failed:

Create a dedicated section listing all failures:

**For Each Failed Item:**

- Category and item text
- Status: FAIL
- Evidence: Full details of what was found
- Location: Specific reference (section, file, line)
- Recommendation: How to fix the issue
- Priority: Based on severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)

**Purpose:** Provides quick reference for remediation work

### 8. Add Recommendations

Include actionable next steps:

**Recommendations based on overall status:**

- **PASS**: Subject meets all checklist criteria, ready to proceed
- **PASS WITH CONCERNS**: Address failed items before final approval
- **FAIL**: Must address all failures before proceeding
- **CRITICAL FAILURE**: Stop all work, address critical issue immediately

**Include:**

- Priority order for addressing failures
- Estimated effort for remediation
- Suggested next steps in workflow

### 9. Save Results

Save the complete results document:

- Write to `reviews/checklist-results/{{checklist-name}}-{{timestamp}}.md`
- Ensure directory exists (create if needed)
- Verify file was written successfully
- Provide user with results file path

**Results file includes:**

- Header with metadata
- Summary statistics
- Results by category (table format)

- List all technical claims to verify

**Purpose:** Understand context and identify verification targets.

### 2. Identify Technical Statements Requiring Verification

Create verification checklist:

**Technical Claims:**

- API behavior descriptions
- Language feature explanations
- Framework concepts
- Performance characteristics
- Security properties
- Compatibility statements
- Version-specific features

**For Each Statement:**

- Quote the exact statement
- Note the location (section, page)
- Identify authoritative source to check
- Mark verification status (pending/verified/incorrect)

**Example Verification List:**

```
Statement: "React's useEffect runs after every render by default"
Location: Chapter 4, Section 2, Page 47
Source: https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect
Status: Pending verification
```

### 3. Verify Technical Statements Against Authoritative Sources

Check each statement for accuracy:

**Authoritative Sources (in priority order):**

1. **Official Documentation**
   - Language docs (Python.org, MDN, docs.oracle.com)
   - Framework official docs (reactjs.org, angular.io, vuejs.org)
   - Library documentation (official repos/sites)

2. **Standards and Specifications**
   - RFCs (IETF specifications)
   - PEPs (Python Enhancement Proposals)
   - ECMAScript specifications
   - W3C standards

3. **Official Release Notes**
   - Version-specific features
   - Deprecation notices
   - Breaking changes

4. **Reputable Technical Sources**
   - Official blogs (Mozilla Hacks, Go Blog, etc.)
   - Conference talks by maintainers
   - Authoritative technical books

**Verification Process:**

For each technical claim:

1. Locate authoritative source
2. Read relevant section carefully
3. Compare claim to source
4. Note any discrepancies
5. Check version applicability
6. Record verification result

**Document Findings:**

**For Correct Statements:**

```
Statement: "React's useEffect runs after every render by default"
Verification: CORRECT
Source: https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect
Notes: Confirmed in official docs. True when no dependency array provided.
```

**For Incorrect Statements:**

```
Statement: "Python's len() returns 1-indexed length"
Verification: INCORRECT
Severity: Critical
Correct Info: len() returns 0-indexed count (number of items)
Source: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#len
Example: len([10, 20, 30]) returns 3, not 4
```

**For Imprecise Statements:**

```
Statement: "useEffect runs after render"
Verification: IMPRECISE
Severity: Minor
Correct Info: "useEffect runs after render is committed to the screen (after browser paint)"
Source: https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect
Notes: Original statement is technically correct but lacks precision
```

### 4. Test All Code Examples for Correctness

Validate code execution and output:

**For Each Code Example:**

**Step 1: Extract Code**

- Copy complete code example
- Include all shown imports/dependencies
- Note any setup code mentioned

**Step 2: Set Up Test Environment**

- Install correct language/framework versions
- Install required dependencies
- Configure environment as specified

**Step 3: Run Code**

- Execute code exactly as shown
- Capture actual output
- Note any errors or warnings

**Step 4: Compare Results**

- Does output match claimed output?
- Does behavior match description?
- Are there any unexpected errors?

**Document Test Results:**

**Working Example:**

```
Location: Chapter 3, Example 3.2
Code: Array.map() example
Test Result: PASS
Output: Matches expected output exactly
Environment: Node.js 20.0.0
```

**Broken Example:**

```
Location: Chapter 5, Example 5.1
Code: Async database query
Test Result: FAIL
Severity: Critical
Error: TypeError: Cannot read property 'query' of undefined
Issue: Missing connection initialization code
Fix: Add `const connection = await createConnection()` before query
```

**Incomplete Example:**

```
Location: Chapter 7, Example 7.3
Code: Express middleware
Test Result: INCOMPLETE
Severity: Major
Issue: Missing import statements (express, body-parser)
Fix: Add required imports at top of example
```

### 5. Check API and Library Usage

Verify API calls are correct and current:

**For Each API/Library Call:**

**Check:**

- Function signature matches documentation
- Parameters in correct order
- Parameter types are correct
- Return type is accurate
- Method exists (not deprecated or renamed)
- Version compatibility

**Common API Issues:**

‚ùå **Incorrect Parameter Order:**

```javascript
// Content claims:
axios.get(headers, url);

// Actual correct usage:
axios.get(url, { headers });
```

‚ùå **Deprecated API:**

```javascript
// Content uses:
ReactDOM.render(<App />, container);

// Current API (React 18+):
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(container);
root.render(<App />);
```

‚ùå **Wrong Return Type:**

```python
# Content claims map() returns a list
result = map(lambda x: x * 2, [1, 2, 3])
# Actually returns an iterator in Python 3

# Correct statement:
result = list(map(lambda x: x * 2, [1, 2, 3]))
```

**Document API Issues:**

```
Location: Chapter 6, Section 3
API: Array.prototype.sort()
Severity: Major
Issue: Claims sort() returns a new array
Correct: sort() mutates the original array in-place and returns reference to it
Source: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort
Impact: Readers may misunderstand side effects
```

### 6. Validate Diagrams Match Descriptions

Ensure visual representations are accurate:

**For Each Diagram:**

**Check:**

- Does diagram accurately represent the concept?
- Do labels match terminology in text?
- Are connections/flows correct?
- Are there any misleading elements?
- Does diagram match code/examples?

**Common Diagram Issues:**

- Arrows pointing wrong direction in data flow
- Components labeled differently than in code
- Missing important elements mentioned in text
- Oversimplification that creates misconceptions

**Document Diagram Issues:**

```
Location: Chapter 4, Figure 4.2
Diagram: React component lifecycle
Severity: Major
Issue: Shows componentWillMount as recommended lifecycle method
Correct: componentWillMount is deprecated (React 16.3+); show componentDidMount instead
Source: https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#componentwillmount
```

### 7. Cross-Check Terminology Consistency

Verify consistent and correct terminology:

**Check:**

- Terms used consistently throughout
- Technical terms spelled correctly
- Acronyms expanded on first use
- No conflating of distinct concepts

**Common Terminology Issues:**

‚ùå **Inconsistent Terms:**

- Uses "function," "method," and "procedure" interchangeably when discussing JavaScript
- Correct: Distinguish class methods from standalone functions

‚ùå **Incorrect Technical Terms:**

- Calls all errors "exceptions" in JavaScript
- Correct: JavaScript has errors; some languages have exceptions with different semantics

‚ùå **Conflated Concepts:**

- Uses "authentication" and "authorization" as synonyms
- Correct: Authentication = who you are, Authorization = what you can do

**Document Terminology Issues:**

```
Location: Throughout Chapter 8
Severity: Minor
Issue: Inconsistent terminology - alternates between "async function" and "asynchronous function"
Recommendation: Choose one term and use consistently (prefer "async function" as it matches the keyword)
```

### 8. Identify Outdated or Deprecated Information

Flag content that needs updating:

**Check For:**

**Deprecated Language Features:**

- Python 2 syntax in Python 3+ content
- var keyword in modern JavaScript guides
- Old-style React class components without hooks mention

**Deprecated APIs:**

- Removed or deprecated functions/methods
- Outdated library APIs
- Framework features replaced by newer approaches

**Outdated Best Practices:**

- Callback-based patterns when async/await is standard
- Older architectural patterns superseded
- Security practices now considered inadequate

**End-of-Life Software:**

- Libraries no longer maintained
- Language versions past EOL
- Frameworks without active support

**Document Outdated Content:**

```
Location: Chapter 9, Section 4
Severity: Major
Issue: Demonstrates Promise chaining with .then()
Current Standard: async/await is now the standard (Node 8+, released 2017)
Recommendation: Show .then() chaining briefly for understanding, then demonstrate async/await as the recommended approach
Source: Modern JavaScript best practices (MDN)
```

```
Location: Chapter 3, Examples
Severity: Critical
Issue: All examples use React class components
Current Standard: Functional components with Hooks (React 16.8+, 2019)
Recommendation: Rewrite examples using functional components with useState, useEffect
Source: https://react.dev/learn - official docs now teach hooks-first
```

### 9. Run Technical Accuracy Checklist

Execute systematic checklist:

**Run:** `execute-checklist.md` with `technical-accuracy-checklist.md`

**Verify:**

- All technical claims verified
- Version numbers correct
- API usage current
- Language features accurate
- Framework concepts correct
- No outdated information

‚úì Includes actionable recommendations

## Examples

### Example: Factual Error Found

**Finding:**

```
Location: Chapter 3, Section 2, Page 34
Statement: "JavaScript's Array.sort() always sorts alphabetically"
Verification: INCORRECT
Severity: Critical

Correct Information:
Array.sort() converts elements to strings and sorts in UTF-16 code unit order by default.
For numbers: [1, 10, 2].sort() returns [1, 10, 2] (NOT [1, 2, 10])
To sort numbers: array.sort((a, b) => a - b)

Source: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort

Impact: Readers will incorrectly sort numeric arrays, causing bugs

Recommended Fix:
"JavaScript's Array.sort() converts elements to strings and sorts in UTF-16 code unit order.
For numeric arrays, provide a compare function: numbers.sort((a, b) => a - b)"
```

### Example: Code Example Failure

**Finding:**

```
Location: Chapter 5, Example 5.3
Code Example: Async database query
Test Result: FAIL
Severity: Critical

Error:
```

TypeError: Cannot read property 'query' of undefined
at example5-3.js:10:25

````

Issue: Missing database connection initialization
The example calls db.query() but never shows db connection setup

Fixed Code:
```javascript
// Add before the query:
const db = await createConnection({
  host: 'localhost',
  user: 'root',
  password: 'password',
  database: 'testdb'
})

// Then the query works:
const results = await db.query('SELECT * FROM users')
````

Recommendation: Either add connection setup to example, or add a note:
"Assuming db connection is already established (see Chapter 4)"

```

### Example: Deprecated API Usage

**Finding:**

```

Location: Chapter 7, Throughout
API: ReactDOM.render()
Severity: Major

Issue: All examples use ReactDOM.render(<App />, root)
This API is deprecated in React 18 (March 2022)

Current API:

```javascript
// Old (deprecated):
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));

// Current (React 18+):
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);
```

Source: https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/08/react-18-upgrade-guide

Recommendation: Update all examples to use createRoot API, or add prominent warning that examples use React 17 API

```

## Next Steps

After verification:

1. Deliver verification report to author
2. Author addresses critical issues (must fix)
3. Author addresses major issues (should fix)
4. Re-verify code examples if critical fixes made
5. Approve for next review phase (editorial/QA)

# Technical Writing Standards

Comprehensive standards for creating clear, consistent, accessible, and well-structured technical content. These principles apply across all publishers and formats.

## Clarity Principles

### Use Simple, Direct Language

**Do:**

- "Click the Submit button" (clear, direct)
- "The function returns a boolean value" (precise)
- "Remove the file" (simple verb)

**Don't:**

- "Utilize the Submit functionality to initiate the process" (unnecessarily complex)
- "The function facilitates the return of a boolean-type value" (wordy)
- "Effect the removal of the file" (pretentious)

### Explain Technical Terms

**First Use Pattern:**

```
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data format...
[Later in text]
...parse the JSON data...
```

**Inline Explanation:**

```
The API returns a 401 status code, which indicates unauthorized access.
```

**Glossary Reference:**

```
The service uses OAuth2 for authentication (see Glossary).
```

### Provide Examples

**Abstract Concept:**

```
‚ùå "Functions should be idempotent."

‚úì "Functions should be idempotent - producing the same result when called multiple times with the same input. For example, `getUserById(123)` should always return the same user data for ID 123."
```

**Show, Then Tell:**

```python
# Example first
def calculate_total(items):
    return sum(item.price for item in items)

# Then explain
The calculate_total function demonstrates list comprehension,
a Pythonic way to iterate and transform data in a single line.
```

### Break Down Complex Ideas

**Step-by-Step:**

```
To implement authentication:
1. Create a User model with password hashing
2. Build registration endpoint to create users
3. Implement login endpoint to verify credentials
4. Generate JWT token upon successful login
5. Create middleware to validate tokens
6. Protect routes using the middleware
```

**Progressive Disclosure:**

- Start with simplest case
- Add complexity incrementally
- Reference advanced topics for later

### Active Voice

**Prefer Active:**

- "The function returns an array" (active)
- "Pass the parameter to the function" (active)
- "The compiler throws an error" (active)

**Avoid Passive:**

- "An array is returned by the function" (passive)
- "The parameter should be passed to the function" (passive)
- "An error is thrown by the compiler" (passive)

**Exception:** Passive voice appropriate when actor is unknown or unimportant:

- "The file was corrupted" (we don't know who/what corrupted it)
- "Python was released in 1991" (focus on Python, not Guido)

### Sentence Clarity

**One Idea Per Sentence:**

```
‚ùå "The function validates the input and then transforms it to the required format and returns it to the caller or throws an error if validation fails."

‚úì "The function first validates the input. If validation succeeds, it transforms the data to the required format and returns it. If validation fails, it throws an error."
```

**Specific vs Vague:**

```
‚ùå "The database might have some issues with performance."
‚úì "Query response time increases from 50ms to 2 seconds when the users table exceeds 1 million rows."
```

---

## Consistency Requirements

### Terminology Consistency

**Choose One Term:**

```
‚úì Consistent: "function" throughout
‚ùå Inconsistent: "function", "method", "routine", "procedure" interchangeably
```

**Create a Term List:**

```
Preferred Terms:
- "filesystem" (not "file system")
- "username" (not "user name")
- "backend" (not "back-end" or "back end")
- "email" (not "e-mail")
- "GitHub" (not "Github")
```

### Style Consistency

**Code Formatting:**

```
‚úì Consistent:
Use `variable_name` for variables and `function_name()` for functions.

‚ùå Inconsistent:
Use variable_name for variables and function_name() for functions.
(Missing backticks, inconsistent formatting)
```

**Heading Capitalization:**

```
‚úì Title Case Consistent:
## Chapter 1: Building Your First API
## Chapter 2: Adding Authentication
## Chapter 3: Deploying to Production

‚úì Sentence Case Consistent:
## Chapter 1: Building your first API
## Chapter 2: Adding authentication
## Chapter 3: Deploying to production

‚ùå Inconsistent Mix:
## Chapter 1: Building your First API
## Chapter 2: Adding Authentication
```

### Voice and Tone

**Maintain Consistent Perspective:**

```
‚úì Second Person Throughout:
"You create a function by using the def keyword. You then add parameters..."

‚ùå Mixed Perspectives:
"You create a function by using the def keyword. We then add parameters..."
"One creates a function by using the def keyword..."
```

**Consistent Formality Level:**

- Casual: "Let's dive in!", "Cool!", "Pretty neat, right?"
- Professional: "We'll begin", "Effective", "This demonstrates"
- Pick one and maintain throughout

### Formatting Patterns

**Code Blocks:**

```
‚úì Consistent:
All code blocks use language tags and show complete context

‚ùå Inconsistent:
Some with language tags, some without; some show imports, some don't
```

**Lists:**

```
‚úì Parallel Structure:
- Create the database
- Configure the connection
- Test the setup

‚ùå Non-Parallel:
- Create the database
- Configuring the connection
- You should test the setup
```

---

## Accessibility Standards

### Alt Text for Images

**Descriptive Alt Text:**

```
‚ùå <img alt="screenshot">
‚ùå <img alt="Figure 1">

‚úì <img alt="Django admin interface showing user list with filter sidebar">
‚úì <img alt="Error message: 'Connection refused on localhost:5432'">
```

**Complex Diagrams:**

```
<img alt="Authentication flow diagram" longdesc="auth-flow-description.html">

In text or linked file:
"The authentication flow begins with the client sending credentials to
the /login endpoint. The server validates these against the database.
If valid, a JWT token is generated and returned. The client includes
this token in subsequent requests via the Authorization header..."
```

### Color and Visual Information

**Don't Rely on Color Alone:**

```
‚ùå "The red items are errors, green items are successes."

‚úì "Errors are marked with a red X icon (‚ùå), while successes show a green checkmark (‚úì)."
```

**Code Syntax Highlighting:**

```
# Ensure code is understandable without color

‚ùå Relying only on color to show strings vs keywords

‚úì Use descriptive comments:
# This string contains the API key:
api_key = "abc123xyz"
```

### Document Structure

**Proper Heading Hierarchy:**

```
‚úì Correct:
# Chapter 1: Introduction (H1)
## Section 1.1: Prerequisites (H2)
### Installing Python (H3)
### Installing VS Code (H3)
## Section 1.2: Your First Program (H2)

‚ùå Incorrect:
# Chapter 1: Introduction (H1)
### Installing Python (H3) - skipped H2
## Your First Program (H2) - after H3
```

**Meaningful Headings:**

```
‚úì Descriptive: "Installing PostgreSQL on macOS"
‚ùå Generic: "Installation" or "Next Steps"
```

### Screen Reader Considerations

**Link Text:**

```
‚ùå "Click [here] to download Python."
‚ùå "Learn more at [this link]."

‚úì "[Download Python 3.11 for Windows]"
‚úì "Read the [official Django tutorial]"
```

**Table Structure:**

```
| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Data 1A  | Data 2A  | Data 3A  |

‚úì Uses proper markdown table format with headers
‚úì Screen readers can navigate by rows/columns
```

**Code Examples:**

```python
# Use descriptive variable names that make sense when read aloud
‚úì user_email = "user@example.com"
‚ùå x = "user@example.com"

# Function names should be read able
‚úì calculate_total_price()
‚ùå calc_tot()
```

### Plain Language

**Acronyms:**

```
‚úì "REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style..."
Later: "...using REST APIs..."

‚ùå Assuming knowledge: "Using REST..." (no definition)
```

**Define Jargon:**

```
‚úì "Idempotent operations produce the same result when executed multiple times."
‚ùå "Operations should be idempotent." (no explanation)
```

## Structure Best Practices

### Logical Topic Progression

**Foundation First:**

```
Chapter Sequence:
1. Python Basics ‚Üí 2. Functions ‚Üí 3. Classes ‚Üí 4. Advanced OOP
(Each builds on previous)

‚ùå Poor Sequence:
1. Advanced OOP ‚Üí 2. Classes ‚Üí 3. Python Basics
```

**Dependency Management:**

```
‚úì "In Chapter 2, we learned about functions. Now we'll use functions to..."
‚úì "This builds on the authentication system from Chapter 5..."

‚ùå Referencing concepts not yet covered without explanation
```

### Section Organization

**Consistent Chapter Structure:**

```
Chapter Template:
1. Introduction (hooks, context, objectives)
2. Prerequisites
3. Concept Explanation
4. Tutorial/Hands-On
5. Exercises
6. Summary
7. Further Reading

Use same structure for every chapter (readers know what to expect)
```

**Section Length:**

- Chapters: 15-30 pages typical
- Major sections: 3-8 pages
- Subsections: 1-3 pages
- Keep related content together

### Transitions

**Between Sections:**

```
‚úì "Now that you understand basic routing, let's add authentication to protect routes."

‚úì "With the database configured, we're ready to create our first model."

‚ùå Abrupt jump to new topic without connection
```

**Between Chapters:**

```
Chapter End: "In the next chapter, we'll deploy this application to production."

Next Chapter Start: "In Chapter 5, we built a REST API. Now we'll deploy it using Docker and AWS."
```

### Cross-References

**Specific References:**

```
‚úì "See Chapter 3, Section 3.2: Database Setup"
‚úì "As explained in the Authentication section on page 45..."

‚ùå "As mentioned earlier..."
‚ùå "See above..."
```

**Forward References:**

```
‚úì "We'll cover error handling in depth in Chapter 8."
‚úì "Advanced caching strategies are beyond this book's scope. See 'High Performance Python' by Gorelick and Ozsvald."

Manage expectations about what's covered where
```

### Visual Hierarchy

**Use Formatting:**

- **Bold** for emphasis or key terms
- `Code formatting` for inline code
- > Blockquotes for important callouts
- Lists for series of items
- Tables for structured data

**Consistent Callouts:**

```
**Note:** Additional information
**Warning:** Potential pitfall
**Tip:** Helpful suggestion
**Exercise:** Practice opportunity
```

## Code Documentation Standards

### Code Comments

**Explain Why, Not What:**

```python
‚ùå # Set x to 5
x = 5

‚úì # Default timeout in seconds
timeout = 5

‚úì # Use exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming the API
for attempt in range(max_retries):
    time.sleep(2 ** attempt)
```

**Document Intent:**

```python
‚úì # Remove duplicates while preserving order
seen = set()
result = [x for x in items if not (x in seen or seen.add(x))]

‚ùå # Loop through items
for item in items:
    # Do something
    ...
```

### Function Documentation

**Docstring Standard:**

```python
def authenticate_user(username, password):
    """
    Authenticate user credentials against the database.

    Args:
        username (str): The user's username
        password (str): The user's plain-text password

    Returns:
        User: The authenticated user object

    Raises:
        AuthenticationError: If credentials are invalid
        DatabaseError: If database connection fails

    Example:
        >>> user = authenticate_user("john", "secret123")
        >>> print(user.email)
        john@example.com
    """
```

### API Documentation

**Endpoint Description:**

```
GET /api/users/:id

Description: Retrieve a single user by ID

Parameters:
- id (path): User ID (integer)

Headers:
- Authorization: Bearer token required

Response 200:
{
  "id": 123,
  "username": "john",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}

Response 404:
{
  "error": "User not found"
}
```
