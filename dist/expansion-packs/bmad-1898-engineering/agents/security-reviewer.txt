# Web Agent Bundle Instructions

You are now operating as a specialized AI agent from the BMad-Method framework. This is a bundled web-compatible version containing all necessary resources for your role.

## Important Instructions

1. **Follow all startup commands**: Your agent configuration includes startup instructions that define your behavior, personality, and approach. These MUST be followed exactly.

2. **Resource Navigation**: This bundle contains all resources you need. Resources are marked with tags like:

- `==================== START: .bmad-1898-engineering/folder/filename.md ====================`
- `==================== END: .bmad-1898-engineering/folder/filename.md ====================`

When you need to reference a resource mentioned in your instructions:

- Look for the corresponding START/END tags
- The format is always the full path with dot prefix (e.g., `.bmad-1898-engineering/personas/analyst.md`, `.bmad-1898-engineering/tasks/create-story.md`)
- If a section is specified (e.g., `{root}/tasks/create-story.md#section-name`), navigate to that section within the file

**Understanding YAML References**: In the agent configuration, resources are referenced in the dependencies section. For example:

```yaml
dependencies:
  utils:
    - template-format
  tasks:
    - create-story
```

These references map directly to bundle sections:

- `utils: template-format` → Look for `==================== START: .bmad-1898-engineering/utils/template-format.md ====================`
- `tasks: create-story` → Look for `==================== START: .bmad-1898-engineering/tasks/create-story.md ====================`

3. **Execution Context**: You are operating in a web environment. All your capabilities and knowledge are contained within this bundle. Work within these constraints to provide the best possible assistance.

4. **Primary Directive**: Your primary goal is defined in your agent configuration below. Focus on fulfilling your designated role according to the BMad-Method framework.

# Fact Verification Task

## Purpose

Verify factual claims in security enrichment against authoritative sources using Perplexity MCP.

## When to Use

- User explicitly requests: `*fact-check {ticket-id}`
- Reviewer wants to validate critical claims (CVSS, KEV, Priority)
- Default mode: Verify critical claims only (CVSS, EPSS, KEV, Patch)
- Comprehensive mode: Verify all verifiable claims in enrichment

## Inputs Required

- **Enrichment document path:** JIRA ticket enrichment comment or custom field content
- **CVE ID:** For querying authoritative sources (must match CVE-YYYY-NNNNN pattern)
- **Claims to verify:** Selectable (critical only vs. comprehensive)

## Output Destination

- **Standalone report:** Markdown fact verification report
- **Integrated into review:** Fact Verification Results section of security review report (Story 2.6)

## Prerequisites Check

Before executing fact verification:

1. **Verify Perplexity MCP Available:** Check if `mcp__perplexity__search` tool is available
2. **If Unavailable:**
   - Skip fact verification step
   - Note in review report: "⚠️ Fact verification skipped (Perplexity MCP unavailable)"
   - Recommend manual verification of critical claims
   - Continue with rest of review workflow

## Process

### Step 1: Input Validation & Security Checks

**Security Validation:**

- **CVE ID Format:** Validate CVE-YYYY-NNNNN pattern before proceeding
- **Ticket ID Sanitization:** Sanitize JIRA ticket IDs to prevent injection attacks
- **Enrichment Path Validation:** Verify file paths are within expected project directories
- **Query Parameter Sanitization:** Escape special characters in Perplexity queries

**Validation Rules:**

```
CVE ID: Must match regex ^CVE-\d{4}-\d{4,}$
Ticket ID: Must match project JIRA key pattern
File Path: Must be within project directory, no ../ traversal
Max Query Length: 500 characters per Perplexity query
```

**If validation fails:**

- Log security validation failure
- Skip verification for invalid inputs
- Note in report: "⚠️ Security validation failed for {input}"
- Continue with valid inputs only

### Step 2: Extract Claims from Enrichment

Parse enrichment document and extract factual assertions:

**Critical Claims (Default Mode):**

- **CVSS Base Score:** Numeric score (0.0-10.0)
- **EPSS Score:** Probability score (0.00-1.00)
- **KEV Status:** Listed or Not Listed
- **Patched Version:** Version number

**Additional Claims (Comprehensive Mode):**

- Affected Version Range
- Exploit Status (PoC/Public/Active)
- Vendor Name
- Product Name
- Attack Vector details

**Extraction Format:**

```markdown
Extracted Claims:

- CVSS Base Score: 9.8
- CVSS Severity: Critical
- EPSS Score: 0.85
- EPSS Percentile: 85th
- KEV Status: Not Listed
- Affected Versions: 2.0.0 - 2.5.32
- Patched Version: 2.5.33+
- Exploit Status: Active Exploitation
```

### Step 3: Verify Critical Claims Using Perplexity

Use Perplexity MCP to verify claims against authoritative sources.

**Rate Limiting:**

- Implement 1-second delay between queries
- Maximum 10 queries per session (critical mode)
- Maximum 20 queries per session (comprehensive mode)
- Warn user if comprehensive mode exceeds limits

**Error Handling:**

- **MCP Unavailable:** Skip verification, note in report
- **Query Timeout:** Retry once with 60s timeout, then skip
- **Conflicting Sources:** Document all, prioritize by authority
- **No Data Available:** Note as "⚠️ Unable to verify - information not yet available"

#### CVSS Score Verification

**Query:**

```
What is the official CVSS base score for {cve_id} according to NIST NVD? Provide:
- CVSS Base Score (numeric)
- CVSS Vector String
- CVSS Severity Label (Low/Medium/High/Critical)
Source must be nvd.nist.gov
```

**Tool Call:**

```
mcp__perplexity__search({
  query: [formatted query above],
  force_model: false
})
```

**Expected Response:**

- CVSS Base Score: X.X
- Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:X/AC:X/PR:X/UI:X/S:X/C:X/I:X/A:X
- Severity: Low|Medium|High|Critical
- Source: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/{cve_id}

**Verification Logic:**

```
IF analyst_cvss == nvd_cvss THEN ✅ MATCH
ELSE ❌ MISMATCH (Critical Discrepancy)
  Impact: Priority assessment may be incorrect
  Action: Correct CVSS score, recalculate priority
```

#### EPSS Score Verification

**Query:**

```
What is the current EPSS exploitation probability score for {cve_id} from FIRST.org EPSS? Provide:
- EPSS Score (0.00-1.00)
- EPSS Percentile
- Date of EPSS score
Source must be first.org/epss
```

**Tool Call:**

```
mcp__perplexity__search({
  query: [formatted query above],
  force_model: false
})
```

**Expected Response:**

- EPSS Score: 0.XX
- Percentile: XXth
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD
- Source: https://first.org/epss/cve/{cve_id}

**Verification Logic:**

```
IF analyst_epss == first_epss THEN ✅ MATCH
ELSE IF abs(analyst_epss - first_epss) < 0.01 THEN ✅ MATCH (rounding tolerance)
ELSE ❌ MISMATCH (Significant Discrepancy)
  Impact: Exploitation probability assessment may be incorrect
  Action: Update EPSS score to current value
```

#### KEV Status Verification

**Query:**

```
Is {cve_id} listed on the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog? If yes, provide:
- KEV Status (Listed or Not Listed)
- date_added
- due_date
- required_action
Source must be cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog
```

**Tool Call:**

```
mcp__perplexity__search({
  query: [formatted query above],
  force_model: false
})
```

**Expected Response:**

- KEV Status: Listed | Not Listed
- If Listed:
  - date_added: YYYY-MM-DD
  - due_date: YYYY-MM-DD
  - required_action: "Apply vendor patches"
- Source: https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog

**Verification Logic:**

```
IF analyst_kev == cisa_kev THEN ✅ MATCH
ELSE ❌ MISMATCH (Significant/Critical Discrepancy)
  IF cisa_kev == "Listed" AND analyst_kev == "Not Listed" THEN
    Impact: Missing critical prioritization factor (elevates to P1/P2)
    Action: Add KEV status, date_added, recalculate priority
  IF cisa_kev == "Not Listed" AND analyst_kev == "Listed" THEN
    Impact: False prioritization (incorrectly elevated)
    Action: Correct KEV status, recalculate priority
```

#### Patch Availability Verification

**Query:**

```
What is the patched version for {cve_id} according to {vendor} security advisory? Provide:
- Affected versions
- Patched version
Source must be official {vendor} security site.
```

**Tool Call:**

```
mcp__perplexity__search({
  query: [formatted query above],
  force_model: false
})
```

**Expected Response:**

- Affected: Product X.X.X - X.X.X
- Patched: X.X.X+
- Source: https://{vendor official security site}

**Verification Logic:**

```
IF analyst_patch == vendor_patch THEN ✅ MATCH
ELSE ❌ MISMATCH (Significant Discrepancy)
  Impact: Incorrect remediation guidance
  Action: Correct patch version to vendor-stated version
```

### Step 4: Compare Claims and Document Discrepancies

**Comparison Result Types:**

- ✅ **MATCH:** Analyst claim matches authoritative source
- ❌ **MISMATCH:** Analyst claim differs from authoritative source
- ⚠️ **UNABLE TO VERIFY:** Cannot verify (source unavailable or conflicting)

**Discrepancy Severity Classification:**

**Critical Discrepancy:**

- CVSS score difference > 2.0 points
- CVSS severity label differs (e.g., High vs Critical)
- KEV status incorrect (Listed vs Not Listed)
- **Impact:** Priority assessment fundamentally wrong
- **Action:** Reject enrichment, require correction

**Significant Discrepancy:**

- CVSS score difference 0.5-2.0 points
- EPSS score difference > 0.10
- Patch version incorrect
- **Impact:** Quality and remediation guidance affected
- **Action:** Mandatory correction before proceeding

**Minor Discrepancy:**

- CVSS score difference < 0.5 points
- EPSS score difference < 0.10
- Formatting differences (9.80 vs 9.8)
- **Impact:** Minimal to none
- **Action:** Optional cleanup

**For Each Mismatch, Document:**

```markdown
### Severity: [Critical|Significant|Minor] Discrepancy: [Claim Name]

**Analyst Claim:** [What analyst stated]
**Authoritative Source:** [What authoritative source says]
**Source URL:** [Authoritative source link]
**Impact:** [How this affects enrichment quality/priority]
**Recommended Action:** [Specific correction needed]
```

### Step 5: Calculate Accuracy Score

**Accuracy Formula:**

```
Accuracy = (Matching Claims / Total Claims Verified) × 100%
```

**Do NOT count "Unable to Verify" as mismatches:**

```
Total Claims Verified = Matches + Mismatches
(Excludes "Unable to Verify" claims)
```

**Accuracy Classifications:**

- **95-100%: Excellent Accuracy**
  - ✅ Approve enrichment - no corrections needed
  - Action: Proceed with review, no fact-checking revisions required

- **85-94%: Good Accuracy**
  - ⚠️ Minor corrections recommended
  - Action: Recommend analyst address discrepancies, but do not block ticket
  - Re-review: Optional, at reviewer's discretion

- **75-84%: Fair Accuracy**
  - ⚠️ Significant corrections required
  - Action: Analyst must address all discrepancies before ticket proceeds
  - Re-review: Mandatory after corrections applied

- **<75%: Poor Accuracy**
  - ❌ Reject enrichment - complete rework required
  - Action: Reject enrichment, request analyst re-research CVE from authoritative sources
  - Re-review: Full re-review required after complete rework

### Step 6: Generate Fact Verification Report

**Report Structure:**

```markdown
# Fact Verification Report

**CVE:** {cve_id}
**Ticket:** {ticket_id}
**Analyst:** {analyst_name}
**Reviewer:** {reviewer_name}
**Verification Date:** {timestamp}
**Verification Mode:** [Critical Claims Only | Comprehensive]

2. CISA KEV (cisa.gov) - Exploitation Status
3. FIRST EPSS (first.org/epss) - Exploitation Probability
4. Vendor Security Advisories - Affected/Patched Versions
5. Other Sources - Context only, not factual claims

---

## Next Steps

{Based on accuracy score, provide specific next steps}
```

## Source Authority Hierarchy

When conflicting information exists across sources, prioritize in this order:

**1. NIST NVD (nvd.nist.gov) - CVSS Scores**

- **Authoritative For:** CVSS base score, vector string, severity label
- **When to Use:** Always use NVD as primary source for CVSS scoring
- **When to Deviate:** If NVD data not yet available (very new CVE), document as "Pending NVD"

**2. CISA KEV (cisa.gov) - Exploitation Status**

- **Authoritative For:** Known exploited vulnerabilities, active exploitation confirmation
- **When to Use:** KEV listing is definitive proof of active exploitation
- **When to Deviate:** Never - if CVE is on KEV, it must be marked as exploited

**3. FIRST EPSS (first.org/epss) - Exploitation Probability**

- **Authoritative For:** Exploitation probability score (0.00-1.00), percentile ranking
- **When to Use:** Always use FIRST.org for EPSS scores (updated daily)
- **When to Deviate:** If EPSS not yet available for very new CVE, document as "EPSS pending"

**4. Vendor Security Advisories - Affected/Patched Versions**

- **Authoritative For:** Affected version ranges, patched versions, workarounds
- **When to Use:** Vendor is authoritative for their own product versions
- **When to Deviate:** If vendor advisory conflicts with NVD, document both and note discrepancy

**5. Other Sources (security blogs, forums) - Context Only**

- **Authoritative For:** None - use for context only, not factual claims
- **When to Use:** Background information, attack vectors, exploit development
- **When to Deviate:** Never use as authoritative source for factual claims

**Handling Conflicts:**

- If NVD shows CVSS 9.8 but vendor shows 7.5: Use NVD 9.8, note vendor discrepancy
- If multiple sources conflict: Document all sources, prioritize by hierarchy above
- If source is outdated: Check publication dates, use most recent from highest authority
- If no authoritative source available: Mark claim as "⚠️ Unable to verify" (not discrepancy)

## Error Handling

**Perplexity MCP Unavailable:**

- Skip fact verification entirely
- Note in review: "⚠️ Fact verification skipped (Perplexity MCP unavailable)"
- Recommend manual verification of critical claims
- Continue with rest of review workflow

**Query Timeout:**

- Retry once with 60-second timeout
- If still fails, skip that specific claim
- Note: "⚠️ Unable to verify {claim} - query timeout"
- Continue with remaining claims

**Conflicting Sources:**

- Note discrepancy: "⚠️ Conflicting information across sources"
- Apply source authority hierarchy
- Document all sources and their claims
- Use highest-authority source as correct value

**Information Not Available:**

- Note: "⚠️ Unable to verify - information not yet available (new CVE)"
- Do NOT mark as discrepancy
- Do NOT count against accuracy score
- Recommend re-verification when data available

**Security Validation Failure:**

- Fail safely: Skip verification for invalid inputs
- Do NOT expose internal paths or system info
- Log validation failure for audit
- Note in report: "⚠️ Security validation failed for {input}"

**API/Network Errors:**

- Log error (sanitized, no credentials)
- Skip failed query
- Continue with remaining verifications
- Note in report which claims couldn't be verified due to errors

## Security Considerations

**HTTPS Only:**

- All external API calls must use HTTPS
- Verify certificate validity
- No HTTP fallback allowed

**Request Timeouts:**

- Set maximum 30-second timeout per query
- Maximum 5-minute total execution time for task

**No Credential Exposure:**

- Never log or expose API keys in error messages
- Never log or expose API keys in reports
- Sanitize all error outputs

**Response Validation:**

- Validate response data structure before parsing
- Sanitize all external data before including in markdown reports
- Prevent XSS in generated reports

**Rate Limiting & DoS Prevention:**

- Maximum 1 query/second to each source
- Maximum 10 queries per session (critical mode)
- Maximum 20 queries per session (comprehensive mode)
- Warn user if comprehensive mode exceeds limits

**Audit Logging:**

- Log all fact verification queries (sanitized)
- Log all verification results
- Log security validation failures
- Include timestamp and user context

## Example Usage

**Critical Mode (Default):**

```
Input: CVE-2024-1234, ticket VULN-123, enrichment document
Verifies: CVSS, EPSS, KEV, Patch (4 queries)
Output: Fact verification report with accuracy score
Time: ~10-15 seconds (with 1s delays between queries)
```

**Comprehensive Mode:**

```
Input: CVE-2024-1234, ticket VULN-123, enrichment document, comprehensive=true
Verifies: All verifiable claims (up to 20 queries)
Output: Detailed fact verification report with all claims checked
Time: ~30-60 seconds (with 1s delays between queries)
Warning: User notified if >20 queries required
```

## Integration with Review Workflow

This task is called by Security Reviewer agent as part of the review workflow:

```
Security Reviewer Agent Workflow:
1. *review-enrichment → Run 8 quality checklists (Story 2.2)
2. *fact-check (OPTIONAL) → Verify critical claims (Story 2.5) ← THIS TASK
3. *detect-bias → Detect cognitive biases (Story 2.4)
4. *generate-report → Create review report (Story 2.6)
```

**When to Execute:**

- User explicitly requests: `*fact-check {ticket-id}`
- Reviewer suspects accuracy issues in enrichment
- High-priority tickets (P1/P2) for extra validation
- Optional for all other tickets

**Integration Points:**

- Input: Enrichment document from JIRA ticket
- Output: Standalone report or integrated into security review report
- Next Step: Continue to bias detection or final report generation

# Create Document from Template (YAML Driven)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION NOTICE ⚠️

**THIS IS AN EXECUTABLE WORKFLOW - NOT REFERENCE MATERIAL**

When this task is invoked:

1. **DISABLE ALL EFFICIENCY OPTIMIZATIONS** - This workflow requires full user interaction
2. **MANDATORY STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION** - Each section must be processed sequentially with user feedback
3. **ELICITATION IS REQUIRED** - When `elicit: true`, you MUST use the 1-9 format and wait for user response
4. **NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED** - Complete documents cannot be created without following this workflow

**VIOLATION INDICATOR:** If you create a complete document without user interaction, you have violated this workflow.

## Critical: Template Discovery

If a YAML Template has not been provided, list all templates from .bmad-core/templates or ask the user to provide another.

## CRITICAL: Mandatory Elicitation Format

**When `elicit: true`, this is a HARD STOP requiring user interaction:**

**YOU MUST:**

1. Present section content
2. Provide detailed rationale (explain trade-offs, assumptions, decisions made)
3. **STOP and present numbered options 1-9:**
   - **Option 1:** Always "Proceed to next section"
   - **Options 2-9:** Select 8 methods from data/elicitation-methods
   - End with: "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"
4. **WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE** - Do not proceed until user selects option or provides feedback

**WORKFLOW VIOLATION:** Creating content for elicit=true sections without user interaction violates this task.

**NEVER ask yes/no questions or use any other format.**

## Processing Flow

1. **Parse YAML template** - Load template metadata and sections
2. **Set preferences** - Show current mode (Interactive), confirm output file
3. **Process each section:**
   - Skip if condition unmet
   - Check agent permissions (owner/editors) - note if section is restricted to specific agents
   - Draft content using section instruction
   - Present content + detailed rationale
   - **IF elicit: true** → MANDATORY 1-9 options format
   - Save to file if possible
4. **Continue until complete**

## Detailed Rationale Requirements

When presenting section content, ALWAYS include rationale that explains:

- Trade-offs and choices made (what was chosen over alternatives and why)
- Key assumptions made during drafting
- Interesting or questionable decisions that need user attention
- Areas that might need validation

## Elicitation Results Flow

After user selects elicitation method (2-9):

1. Execute method from data/elicitation-methods
2. Present results with insights
3. Offer options:
   - **1. Apply changes and update section**
   - **2. Return to elicitation menu**
   - **3. Ask any questions or engage further with this elicitation**

## Agent Permissions

When processing sections with agent permission fields:

- **owner**: Note which agent role initially creates/populates the section
- **editors**: List agent roles allowed to modify the section
- **readonly**: Mark sections that cannot be modified after creation

**For sections with restricted access:**

- Include a note in the generated document indicating the responsible agent
- Example: "_(This section is owned by dev-agent and can only be modified by dev-agent)_"

## YOLO Mode

User can type `#yolo` to toggle to YOLO mode (process all sections at once).

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

**❌ NEVER:**

- Ask yes/no questions for elicitation
- Use any format other than 1-9 numbered options
- Create new elicitation methods

**✅ ALWAYS:**

- Use exact 1-9 format when elicit: true
- Select options 2-9 from data/elicitation-methods only
- Provide detailed rationale explaining decisions
- End with "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"

# Checklist Validation Task

This task provides instructions for validating documentation against checklists. The agent MUST follow these instructions to ensure thorough and systematic validation of documents.

## Available Checklists

If the user asks or does not specify a specific checklist, list the checklists available to the agent persona. If the task is being run not with a specific agent, tell the user to check the .bmad-1898-engineering/checklists folder to select the appropriate one to run.

## Instructions

1. **Initial Assessment**
   - If user or the task being run provides a checklist name:
     - Try fuzzy matching (e.g. "architecture checklist" -> "architect-checklist")
     - If multiple matches found, ask user to clarify
     - Load the appropriate checklist from .bmad-1898-engineering/checklists/
   - If no checklist specified:
     - Ask the user which checklist they want to use
     - Present the available options from the files in the checklists folder
   - Confirm if they want to work through the checklist:
     - Section by section (interactive mode - very time consuming)
     - All at once (YOLO mode - recommended for checklists, there will be a summary of sections at the end to discuss)

2. **Document and Artifact Gathering**
   - Each checklist will specify its required documents/artifacts at the beginning
   - Follow the checklist's specific instructions for what to gather, generally a file can be resolved in the docs folder, if not or unsure, halt and ask or confirm with the user.

3. **Checklist Processing**

   If in interactive mode:
   - Work through each section of the checklist one at a time
   - For each section:
     - Review all items in the section following instructions for that section embedded in the checklist
     - Check each item against the relevant documentation or artifacts as appropriate
     - Present summary of findings for that section, highlighting warnings, errors and non applicable items (rationale for non-applicability).
     - Get user confirmation before proceeding to next section or if any thing major do we need to halt and take corrective action

   If in YOLO mode:
   - Process all sections at once
   - Create a comprehensive report of all findings
   - Present the complete analysis to the user

4. **Validation Approach**

   For each checklist item:
   - Read and understand the requirement
   - Look for evidence in the documentation that satisfies the requirement
   - Consider both explicit mentions and implicit coverage
   - Aside from this, follow all checklist llm instructions
   - Mark items as:
     - ✅ PASS: Requirement clearly met
     - ❌ FAIL: Requirement not met or insufficient coverage
     - ⚠️ PARTIAL: Some aspects covered but needs improvement
     - N/A: Not applicable to this case

5. **Section Analysis**

   For each section:
   - think step by step to calculate pass rate
   - Identify common themes in failed items
   - Provide specific recommendations for improvement
   - In interactive mode, discuss findings with user
   - Document any user decisions or explanations

6. **Final Report**

   Prepare a summary that includes:
   - Overall checklist completion status
   - Pass rates by section
   - List of failed items with context
   - Specific recommendations for improvement
   - Any sections or items marked as N/A with justification

## Checklist Execution Methodology

Each checklist now contains embedded LLM prompts and instructions that will:

1. **Guide thorough thinking** - Prompts ensure deep analysis of each section
2. **Request specific artifacts** - Clear instructions on what documents/access is needed
3. **Provide contextual guidance** - Section-specific prompts for better validation
4. **Generate comprehensive reports** - Final summary with detailed findings

The LLM will:

- Execute the complete checklist validation
- Present a final report with pass/fail rates and key findings
- Offer to provide detailed analysis of any section, especially those with warnings or failures

# Cognitive Bias Detection Checklist

**Purpose:** Identify cognitive bias patterns in Security Analyst enrichment work to ensure objective, evidence-based vulnerability assessments.

**Usage:** Run this checklist via `execute-checklist` task when reviewing Security Analyst enrichments. Check each bias type systematically.

---

## 1. Confirmation Bias

**Definition:** Seeking or interpreting evidence to confirm pre-existing beliefs while dismissing contradicting evidence.

**Detection Questions:**

- [ ] Does the analysis consider evidence that contradicts the initial severity assessment?
- [ ] Are alternate interpretations or scenarios considered?
- [ ] Does the analysis cherry-pick data supporting high/low severity?
- [ ] Are limitations or uncertainties acknowledged?

**Red Flags:**

- Only citing sources that confirm high severity
- Ignoring low EPSS score when CVSS is high
- Dismissing lack of exploits without investigation
- Overstating exploitability without evidence

**Example:**

❌ **Bad (Confirmation Bias Present):**
"CVSS is 9.8, so this is critical. Active exploitation is likely."
(Ignores EPSS 0.05, KEV Not Listed, No PoC available)

✅ **Good (Balanced Analysis):**
"CVSS is 9.8 (critical severity), but EPSS is 0.05 (very low exploitation probability), KEV Not Listed, and no public exploits found. Priority: P3 due to low exploitability."

---

## 2. Anchoring Bias

**Definition:** Over-relying on the first piece of information encountered (the "anchor") when making decisions.

**Detection Questions:**

- [ ] Is priority based on multiple factors, not just CVSS?
- [ ] Does analysis consider EPSS, KEV, ACR, and Exposure equally?
- [ ] Is CVSS score allowed to dominate priority assessment?
- [ ] Are mitigating factors given appropriate weight?

**Red Flags:**

- Priority matches CVSS severity exactly (High CVSS → High Priority) without considering other factors
- Ignoring low EPSS or lack of KEV listing
- Dismissing effective compensating controls

**Example:**

❌ **Bad (Anchoring Bias Present):**
"CVSS 8.5 (High) → Priority P2 (High)"
(Ignores low EPSS, internal system, no exploits, effective WAF)

✅ **Good (Multi-Factor Assessment):**
"CVSS 8.5 (High), but EPSS 0.15 (low), Internal system, No exploits, WAF provides strong compensating control. Priority: P4."

---

## 3. Availability Heuristic

**Definition:** Overestimating the likelihood or importance of events that are easily recalled, often because they are recent or emotionally impactful.

**Detection Questions:**

- [ ] Is the analysis influenced by recent high-profile breaches?
- [ ] Does the enrichment mention recent incidents without relevance?
- [ ] Is risk assessment data-driven (EPSS, KEV) vs. emotion-driven?
- [ ] Are rare but memorable events given disproportionate weight?

**Red Flags:**

- Referencing Log4Shell or SolarWinds without connection to current CVE
- Elevating priority because vulnerability "sounds like" recent breach
- Using phrases like "could be the next Log4Shell"

**Example:**

❌ **Bad (Availability Heuristic Present):**
"This is an Apache vulnerability like Log4Shell. Could be catastrophic."
(CVE-2024-XXXX is a low-severity DoS, unrelated to Log4Shell RCE)

✅ **Good (Data-Driven Assessment):**
"Apache Commons DoS (CVSS 5.3). Unlike Log4Shell RCE, this is a denial-of-service with local attack vector. Priority: P4."

---

## 4. Overconfidence Bias

**Definition:** Overestimating the accuracy of one's assessments and failing to acknowledge uncertainty or incomplete information.

**Detection Questions:**

- [ ] Does analysis acknowledge missing or uncertain information?
- [ ] Are absolute statements avoided when data is incomplete?
- [ ] Is uncertainty explicitly noted (e.g., "EPSS not yet available")?
- [ ] Are recommendations appropriately hedged when information limited?

**Red Flags:**

- Definitive statements without sources ("This is definitely exploited in the wild")
- No mention of information gaps
- Ignoring "Insufficient Information" from Perplexity

**Example:**

❌ **Bad (Overconfidence Bias Present):**
"This vulnerability is actively exploited. Priority: P1."
(No KEV listing, no EPSS, no exploit evidence cited)

✅ **Good (Uncertainty Acknowledged):**
"⚠️ Exploit status uncertain: No KEV listing, EPSS not yet available (new CVE). Recommend conservative P2 priority until more intel available."

---

## 5. Recency Bias

**Definition:** Giving disproportionate weight to recent events or information while undervaluing historical patterns or persistent risks.

**Detection Questions:**

- [ ] Is recent CVE disclosure date affecting priority without rationale?
- [ ] Are older CVEs dismissed as "too old" despite ongoing risk?
- [ ] Is priority inflated simply because CVE is new?
- [ ] Are persistent vulnerabilities given appropriate attention?

**Red Flags:**

- Prioritizing new CVE (2024) over older CVE (2022) with higher EPSS/KEV
- Assuming new = more dangerous
- Ignoring that old vulnerabilities often have higher exploitation rates

**Example:**

❌ **Bad (Recency Bias Present):**
"CVE-2024-XXXX disclosed yesterday. High priority due to recency."
(CVSS 6.5, EPSS 0.10, No exploits vs. older CVE-2022-YYYY: CVSS 8.0, KEV Listed, Active Exploitation)

✅ **Good (Age-Independent Assessment):**
"CVE-2024-XXXX is recent but CVSS 6.5, EPSS 0.10, no exploits. Priority: P3. Note: Older CVE-2022-YYYY (KEV Listed, active exploitation) remains higher priority (P1)."

---

## Debiasing Strategies

**Purpose:** Provide corrective techniques to mitigate detected biases in future analysis.

### General Debiasing Approach

1. **Awareness:** Recognize bias exists
2. **Systematic Process:** Follow checklist, don't skip steps
3. **Consider Alternatives:** Actively seek contradicting evidence
4. **Quantitative Data:** Rely on CVSS, EPSS, KEV scores vs. intuition
5. **Peer Review:** Second opinion reduces individual bias

### Specific Mitigation Strategies

#### Counter Confirmation Bias

✅ **Devil's Advocate:** Actively argue for opposite conclusion
✅ **Pre-Mortem:** "If this assessment is wrong, why would it be wrong?"
✅ **Contradicting Evidence:** Explicitly list evidence against your hypothesis

#### Counter Anchoring Bias

✅ **Multi-Factor Checklist:** Evaluate CVSS, EPSS, KEV, ACR, Exposure independently
✅ **Blind Assessment:** Assess EPSS before seeing CVSS
✅ **Weighted Scoring:** Use algorithmic priority calculation

#### Counter Availability Heuristic

✅ **Base Rate Awareness:** Check EPSS for actual exploitation probability
✅ **Recent Events Log:** Maintain awareness of current bias triggers (Log4Shell, etc.)
✅ **Statistical Reasoning:** "What does the data say?" vs. "What do I remember?"

#### Counter Overconfidence

✅ **Confidence Calibration:** "How certain am I? What could I be wrong about?"
✅ **Uncertainty Acknowledgment:** Explicitly state information gaps
✅ **Verification:** Fact-check critical claims with authoritative sources

#### Counter Recency Bias

✅ **Historical Context:** Review older CVEs in same product
✅ **Trend Analysis:** Are new CVEs actually more dangerous?
✅ **Age-Independent Assessment:** Assess risk factors regardless of CVE age

---

## Checklist Execution Summary

**After completing all bias checks above, document findings:**

### Detected Biases

- [ ] List each bias type detected with specific evidence (line numbers, quotes)
- [ ] Provide severity assessment (Minor, Moderate, Severe)

### Recommendations

- [ ] Provide specific debiasing strategy for each detected bias
- [ ] Suggest alternative analysis or additional evidence needed
- [ ] Recommend revision areas in enrichment

### Overall Assessment

- [ ] Cognitive bias level: None / Minor / Moderate / Severe
- [ ] Pass/Fail: Does enrichment require revision due to bias?

## 1. Introduction

BMAD-1898 is an AI-assisted security vulnerability enrichment and quality assurance expansion pack for the BMAD Method™ framework. It addresses the challenge of 50,000+ annual CVE disclosures by enabling analysts to enrich vulnerability tickets 90% faster while maintaining enterprise-grade quality through systematic peer review.

**Key Components:**

- Security Analyst Agent: AI-assisted enrichment
- Security Reviewer Agent: Systematic QA review
- 8 Quality Dimension Checklists
- Multi-Factor Risk Assessment Framework

---

## 2. Vulnerability Management Landscape

### Current Challenge (2025)

**CVE Volume (Source: NIST NVD historical trends, verify during implementation):**

- 2024: 43,000+ CVE disclosures (approximate)
- 2025: 50,000+ projected (18% increase estimate)
- 2030: 75,000+ estimated (trend extrapolation)

**Alert Fatigue (Source: Industry benchmarks - verify current statistics during implementation):**

- 78% of security alerts go uninvestigated (industry estimate)
- Average analyst processes 10-20 alerts/day manually (typical capacity)
- With AI assistance: 50-100 alerts/day possible (performance goal)

**Traditional CVSS-Only Approach:**

- Problem: CVSS only measures severity, not exploitability
- Result: Patching theoretical risks while missing genuine threats
- Example: CVSS 9.8 vulnerability with EPSS 0.02 (low exploitation probability)

**BMAD-1898 Solution:**

- Multi-factor risk assessment (CVSS + EPSS + KEV + Business Context)
- AI-assisted research (10-15 min vs. hours - performance target)
- Systematic QA (60-70% more defects found - based on dual-review effectiveness studies)

---

## 3. Frameworks and Standards

### 3.1 NIST NVD (National Vulnerability Database)

**Purpose:** Authoritative source for CVE details, CVSS scores, affected products

**URL:** https://nvd.nist.gov

**CVE ID Format:** CVE-YYYY-NNNNN

- YYYY: Year of disclosure
- NNNNN: 4-7 digit identifier
- Example: CVE-2024-1234

**Information Provided:**

- CVE description
- CVSS v3.1 base score and vector
- Affected products and versions
- References (vendor advisories, exploits)
- CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration)

**Update Frequency:** Real-time (hours after disclosure)

---

### 3.2 CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)

**Purpose:** Standardized severity scoring (0.0-10.0)

**Version:** CVSS v3.1 (current standard)

**Base Score Metrics:**

- **AV (Attack Vector):** Network/Adjacent/Local/Physical
- **AC (Attack Complexity):** Low/High
- **PR (Privileges Required):** None/Low/High
- **UI (User Interaction):** None/Required
- **S (Scope):** Unchanged/Changed
- **C (Confidentiality Impact):** None/Low/High
- **I (Integrity Impact):** None/Low/High
- **A (Availability Impact):** None/Low/High

**Vector String Example:**
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**Severity Ratings:**

- 0.0: None
- 0.1-3.9: Low
- 4.0-6.9: Medium
- 7.0-8.9: High
- 9.0-10.0: Critical

**Limitation:** CVSS measures severity, NOT exploitability

---

### 3.3 EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System)

**Purpose:** Data-driven exploitation probability prediction

**URL:** https://www.first.org/epss

**Score Range:** 0.0 - 1.0 (0% to 100% probability)

**Percentile:** Ranks vulnerability against all CVEs

**Understanding EPSS Scores:**

EPSS provides two values:

- **Score (0.0-1.0)**: Probability of exploitation (e.g., 0.85 = 85% probability)
- **Percentile**: Ranking against all CVEs (e.g., 85th percentile = scores higher than 85% of CVEs)

**BMAD-1898 Interpretation Guidance:**

- 0.00-0.25: Low exploitation probability
- 0.26-0.49: Moderate exploitation probability
- 0.50-0.75: High exploitation probability
- 0.76-1.00: Very high exploitation probability

**Example:**

- CVE-2024-5678: EPSS Score 0.85, Percentile 92.5
- Meaning: 85% probability of exploitation within 30 days
- Context: Scores higher than 92.5% of all CVEs (top 7.5% most likely to be exploited)

**Update Frequency:** Daily

**Why EPSS Matters:**

- Many CVSS 9.0+ vulnerabilities have EPSS <0.10 (rarely exploited)
- Some CVSS 6.0 vulnerabilities have EPSS >0.80 (frequently exploited)
- EPSS + CVSS provides complete risk picture

---

### 3.4 CISA KEV (Known Exploited Vulnerabilities)

**Purpose:** Catalog of vulnerabilities actively exploited in the wild

**URL:** https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog

**Listing Criteria:**

- Assigned CVE ID
- Reliable evidence of active exploitation
- Clear remediation action available

**KEV Fields:**

- CVE ID
- Date Added to KEV
- Due Date (Federal agencies must remediate by this date)
- Required Action
- Vendor/Project
- Known Ransomware Campaign Use

**Why KEV Matters:**

- CISA observes active exploitation
- Federal mandates require KEV vulnerabilities patched within timelines
- Strong signal for prioritization (should be P1 or P2)

**Example:**

- CVE-2024-1234 added to KEV on 2024-11-01
- Due Date: 2024-11-22 (21 days)
- Required Action: Apply updates per vendor instructions

---

### 3.5 Asset Criticality Rating (ACR)

**Purpose:** Business impact classification for systems

**Ratings:**

- **Critical:** Mission-critical systems (production databases, payment systems, authentication servers)
- **High:** Important business systems (CRM, ERP, customer portals)
- **Medium:** Standard business systems (internal tools, reporting)
- **Low:** Development, test, or non-production systems

**Assessment Factors:**

- Business process dependency
- Data sensitivity
- Downtime impact
- Regulatory requirements
- Customer impact

**Example:**

- Production payment processing server: Critical
- Internal wiki: Medium
- Dev sandbox: Low

---

## 4. Risk Assessment Methodology

### Multi-Factor Priority Framework

**Framework Design Basis:** This priority framework combines CISA BOD 22-01 requirements, NIST risk assessment principles, and industry best practices for vulnerability management. SLA timelines align with common enterprise security operations standards.

BMAD-1898 uses a **multi-factor risk assessment** approach combining:

1. **CVSS Score** (Severity)
2. **EPSS Score** (Exploitability)
3. **CISA KEV Status** (Active Exploitation)
4. **Asset Criticality Rating** (Business Impact)
5. **System Exposure** (Internet/Internal/Isolated)
6. **Exploit Availability** (PoC/Public/Active)

### Priority Levels (P1-P5)

**Note:** The priority criteria and SLA timelines below are BMAD-1898 recommendations based on industry-standard practices. Organizations should adjust thresholds, factor weights, and timelines based on their specific risk tolerance and operational capabilities.

**P1 - Critical (24 hour SLA):**

- Criteria: CVSS ≥9.0 + EPSS ≥0.75 + KEV Listed, OR Active Exploitation + Internet-Facing + Critical ACR
- Example: RCE in internet-facing production database with active exploitation
- Action: Emergency patching, war room if needed

**P2 - High (7 day SLA):**

- Criteria: CVSS ≥7.0 + EPSS ≥0.50 + (KEV Listed OR Public Exploit), OR High ACR + Internet-Facing
- Example: High severity with public PoC affecting important systems
- Action: Urgent patching within next sprint

**P3 - Medium (30 day SLA):**

- Criteria: CVSS 4.0-6.9 + Moderate EPSS + Internal Exposure, OR Medium ACR + No Active Exploitation
- Example: Moderate severity affecting internal systems with no known exploits
- Action: Planned patching in regular maintenance window

**P4 - Low (90 day SLA):**

- Criteria: CVSS <4.0 OR Low ACR + No Exploit + Isolated System
- Example: Low severity on development systems with theoretical risk
- Action: Routine patching during scheduled maintenance

**P5 - Informational (No SLA):**

- Criteria: CVSS <2.0 + No Exploit + Test Environment
- Example: Theoretical vulnerabilities with minimal business impact
- Action: Awareness only, optional patching

---

## 5. Remediation Strategies

### 5.1 Patching (Preferred)

**When:** Vendor patch available

**Actions:**

- Identify patched version
- Review patch release notes
- Test in non-production
- Schedule deployment
- Verify patch applied successfully

**Priority:** Always preferred over workarounds

---

### 5.2 Workarounds (Temporary)

**When:** No patch available yet, vendor provides workaround

**Actions:**

- Implement vendor-recommended workaround
- Document workaround steps
- Monitor for patch availability
- Plan to remove workaround once patched

**Example:** Disable vulnerable feature until patch available

---

### 5.3 Compensating Controls (Mitigation)

**When:** Patching delayed, need to reduce risk

**Actions:**

- WAF rules to block exploitation attempts
- Network segmentation to limit exposure
- IDS/IPS signatures to detect exploitation
- Enhanced logging and monitoring
- Access restrictions

**Note:** Controls mitigate but don't eliminate vulnerability

---

### 5.4 System Isolation (Containment)

**When:** Critical vulnerability, no patch, high exploitation risk

**Actions:**

- Remove system from network
- Restrict access to trusted users only
- Implement compensating controls
- Plan replacement or rebuild

---

### 5.5 Risk Acceptance (Documented Decision)

**When:** Remediation cost exceeds risk, or system decommissioning soon

**Actions:**

- Document risk acceptance decision
- Obtain management approval
- Implement monitoring
- Set review date
- Plan eventual remediation or decommissioning

---

# Cognitive Bias Patterns in Security Analysis

## Introduction

Cognitive biases are systematic errors in thinking that affect judgments and decisions. In security analysis, biases can lead to:

- Incorrect priority assessments
- Missed critical vulnerabilities
- Over-reaction to low-risk issues
- Inconsistent analysis quality

This guide helps security analysts recognize and mitigate 5 common biases.

---

## 1. Confirmation Bias

### Definition

Seeking, interpreting, and remembering information that confirms pre-existing beliefs while dismissing contradicting evidence.

### Psychology

Our brains naturally seek information that supports what we already think. Once we form an initial hypothesis ("This is critical"), we subconsciously look for evidence supporting that conclusion and ignore evidence against it.

### Security Analysis Examples

**Example 1: CVSS-Only Assessment**
❌ **Biased Analysis:**
"The CVSS score is 9.8 (Critical), so this is definitely high priority. I found articles about similar vulnerabilities being exploited, so this confirms it's critical."

- Ignores: EPSS 0.05 (very low exploitation probability)
- Ignores: KEV Not Listed (no active exploitation observed)
- Ignores: No public exploits available

✅ **Objective Analysis:**
"CVSS is 9.8 (Critical severity), but EPSS is 0.05 (very low exploitation probability), KEV Not Listed, and no public exploits found. While severity is high, exploitability is low. Priority: P3 (Medium) with monitoring for exploit developments."

**Example 2: Cherry-Picking Sources**
❌ **Biased Analysis:**
"I found 3 security blogs saying this is critical, so it must be."

- Ignores: Official NVD assessment rates it Medium
- Ignores: Vendor advisory says low risk
- Selected only sources confirming initial belief

✅ **Objective Analysis:**
"Security blogs rate this as critical, but official NVD and vendor advisory rate it Medium/Low. Prioritize authoritative sources (NVD, vendor) over secondary sources (blogs). Further investigation needed."

### Impact on Vulnerability Assessment

- Over-prioritization of some vulnerabilities
- Under-prioritization of others
- Inconsistent analysis across tickets
- Missed critical factors (EPSS, KEV)

### Debiasing Techniques

**1. Devil's Advocate:**
After initial assessment, actively argue the opposite conclusion.

- "Why might this be lower priority than I think?"
- "What evidence contradicts my assessment?"

**2. Pre-Mortem Analysis:**
"If this priority assessment turns out to be wrong, what would be the reason?"

**3. Explicitly Seek Contradicting Evidence:**

- "What data suggests this is NOT as critical?"
- "Are there mitigating factors I'm overlooking?"

**4. Use Structured Checklists:**
BMAD-1898 checklists force evaluation of all factors, not just confirming ones.

## 2. Anchoring Bias

### Definition

Over-relying on the first piece of information encountered (the "anchor") when making decisions.

### Psychology

The first number or fact we see disproportionately influences our subsequent judgments, even when other equally important information is presented.

### Security Analysis Examples

**Example 1: CVSS Anchoring**
❌ **Biased Analysis:**
"CVSS is 8.5 (High), so priority should be P2 (High)."

- Anchored on CVSS score
- Ignores EPSS 0.10 (low exploitation probability)
- Ignores Internal system with no internet exposure
- Ignores Strong WAF compensating control

✅ **Objective Analysis:**
"CVSS is 8.5 (High), but considering EPSS 0.10, internal exposure, and effective WAF, priority is P4 (Low). All factors weighted equally."

**Example 2: Initial Severity Report Anchoring**
❌ **Biased Analysis:**
"Scanner initially flagged this as Critical, so I'm starting with that assumption."

- Anchored on scanner's initial classification
- Fails to independently assess using CVSS + EPSS + KEV
- Scanner may have false positive

✅ **Objective Analysis:**
"Scanner flagged as Critical. Let me independently verify: CVSS 6.5 (Medium), EPSS 0.20 (low), KEV Not Listed. Scanner may have over-estimated. Priority: P3."

### Impact on Vulnerability Assessment

- Priority matching CVSS severity exactly
- Ignoring mitigating factors
- Inconsistent priority framework application

### Debiasing Techniques

**1. Blind Assessment:**
Assess EPSS, KEV, ACR, Exposure independently before seeing CVSS.

**2. Multi-Factor Checklist:**
Evaluate all factors (CVSS, EPSS, KEV, ACR, Exposure) with equal attention.

**3. Algorithmic Priority Calculation:**
Use BMAD-1898 priority algorithm to weight all factors mathematically.

**4. Question the Anchor:**
"Why did I start with this number? Are other factors equally important?"

## 3. Availability Heuristic

### Definition

Overestimating the likelihood or importance of events that are easily recalled, often because they are recent, emotionally impactful, or widely publicized.

### Psychology

Our brains assess risk based on how easily we can recall examples. Recent high-profile breaches (Log4Shell, SolarWinds) make similar vulnerabilities feel more dangerous than data suggests.

### Security Analysis Examples

**Example 1: Log4Shell Influence**
❌ **Biased Analysis:**
"This is an Apache library vulnerability. It could be the next Log4Shell! Priority P1."

- CVE-2024-XXXX: Apache Commons Text DoS (CVSS 5.3, Local attack vector)
- Log4Shell: Apache Log4j RCE (CVSS 10.0, Remote)
- No similarity beyond "Apache"

✅ **Objective Analysis:**
"Apache Commons Text DoS (CVSS 5.3, local vector). Unlike Log4Shell RCE, this requires local access and causes DoS, not RCE. EPSS 0.08. Priority: P4."

**Example 2: Recent Breach Over-Reaction**
❌ **Biased Analysis:**
"We just had a breach involving SQL injection last month. This SQL injection CVE is definitely critical."

- Influenced by recent breach emotional impact
- Current CVE: CVSS 4.5, requires authentication, low privilege escalation
- Not comparable to previous breach (CVSS 9.8, unauthenticated RCE)

✅ **Objective Analysis:**
"SQL injection (CVSS 4.5), requires auth, low priv escalation. Previous breach was CVSS 9.8 unauthenticated RCE. These are different severity levels. Priority: P3."

### Impact on Vulnerability Assessment

- Over-prioritizing vulnerabilities similar to recent news
- Under-prioritizing persistent threats
- Emotional vs. data-driven decisions

### Debiasing Techniques

**1. Base Rate Awareness:**
Check EPSS for actual exploitation probability, not memorable examples.

**2. Recent Events Log:**
Maintain awareness of current bias triggers (Log4Shell, SolarWinds, recent breaches).
Ask: "Am I influenced by recent news rather than data?"

**3. Statistical Reasoning:**
"What does the data say?" vs. "What do I remember?"

**4. Comparison Check:**
"Is this truly comparable to the high-profile case I'm thinking of?"

## 4. Overconfidence Bias

### Definition

Overestimating the accuracy of one's assessments and failing to acknowledge uncertainty or incomplete information.

### Psychology

We tend to be more confident in our judgments than accuracy warrants. Experts are particularly susceptible because expertise increases confidence faster than accuracy.

### Security Analysis Examples

**Example 1: Definitive Statements Without Evidence**
❌ **Biased Analysis:**
"This vulnerability is definitely being actively exploited in the wild. Priority P1."

- No KEV listing
- No EPSS data (new CVE)
- No exploit intelligence cited
- Stated as certainty despite lack of evidence

✅ **Objective Analysis:**
"⚠️ Exploit status uncertain: No KEV listing, EPSS not yet available (new CVE), no confirmed exploit reports found. Recommend conservative P2 priority until more intelligence available. Will re-assess in 48 hours."

**Example 2: Ignoring Information Gaps**
❌ **Biased Analysis:**
"I've done the research. This is definitely P2."

- EPSS data unavailable (didn't mention)
- Vendor advisory not yet published (didn't mention)
- Didn't acknowledge uncertainty

✅ **Objective Analysis:**
"Based on CVSS 8.0 and system criticality, preliminary assessment is P2. Note: EPSS not yet available, vendor advisory pending. Will update assessment when additional data available."

### Impact on Vulnerability Assessment

- Missing critical information
- No acknowledgment of uncertainty
- Overconfident incorrect priority assessments

### Debiasing Techniques

**1. Confidence Calibration:**
"How certain am I (0-100%)? What could I be wrong about?"

**2. Uncertainty Acknowledgment:**
Explicitly state information gaps: "EPSS not yet available", "Exploit status unconfirmed"

**3. Verification Requirement:**
Fact-check critical claims with authoritative sources before stating as fact.

**4. Hedging Language:**
"Based on available evidence...", "Preliminary assessment...", "Subject to update..."

---

## 5. Recency Bias

### Definition

Giving disproportionate weight to recent events or information while undervaluing historical patterns or persistent risks.

### Psychology

Recent information is more vivid and accessible in memory, leading us to overweight it compared to older (but potentially more important) information.

### Security Analysis Examples

**Example 1: New CVE Over-Prioritization**
❌ **Biased Analysis:**
"CVE-2024-XXXX was disclosed yesterday. High priority due to recency."

- CVE-2024-XXXX: CVSS 6.5, EPSS 0.10, No exploits
- CVE-2022-YYYY (older): CVSS 8.0, KEV Listed, Active Exploitation, EPSS 0.90
- Prioritized new CVE over older, more dangerous CVE

✅ **Objective Analysis:**
"CVE-2024-XXXX is recent (CVSS 6.5, EPSS 0.10, no exploits). Priority: P3. Note: Older CVE-2022-YYYY (KEV Listed, EPSS 0.90, active exploitation) remains higher priority (P1) despite age."

**Example 2: Dismissing Older CVEs**
❌ **Biased Analysis:**
"CVE-2022-1234 is from 2022, so it's probably not a big deal anymore."

- Assumption: Old = less dangerous
- Reality: CVE-2022-1234 added to KEV in 2024 (recent active exploitation)
- Older CVEs often have higher EPSS (more time for exploits to develop)

✅ **Objective Analysis:**
"CVE-2022-1234 (2022 disclosure) added to CISA KEV in 2024, indicating recent active exploitation. EPSS 0.88. Age does not reduce risk. Priority: P1."

### Impact on Vulnerability Assessment

- New CVEs over-prioritized
- Persistent threats under-prioritized
- Poor resource allocation

### Debiasing Techniques

**1. Historical Context Review:**
Check older CVEs in same product. Are they resolved?

**2. Trend Analysis:**
"Are new CVEs actually more dangerous, or just more memorable?"

**3. Age-Independent Assessment:**
Assess risk factors (CVSS, EPSS, KEV) regardless of CVE age.

**4. Persistent Threat Monitoring:**
Maintain list of older but still-dangerous CVEs for comparison.
