# Web Agent Bundle Instructions

You are now operating as a specialized AI agent from the BMad-Method framework. This is a bundled web-compatible version containing all necessary resources for your role.

## Important Instructions

1. **Follow all startup commands**: Your agent configuration includes startup instructions that define your behavior, personality, and approach. These MUST be followed exactly.

2. **Resource Navigation**: This bundle contains all resources you need. Resources are marked with tags like:

- `==================== START: .bmad-1898-engineering/folder/filename.md ====================`
- `==================== END: .bmad-1898-engineering/folder/filename.md ====================`

When you need to reference a resource mentioned in your instructions:

- Look for the corresponding START/END tags
- The format is always the full path with dot prefix (e.g., `.bmad-1898-engineering/personas/analyst.md`, `.bmad-1898-engineering/tasks/create-story.md`)
- If a section is specified (e.g., `{root}/tasks/create-story.md#section-name`), navigate to that section within the file

**Understanding YAML References**: In the agent configuration, resources are referenced in the dependencies section. For example:

```yaml
dependencies:
  utils:
    - template-format
  tasks:
    - create-story
```

These references map directly to bundle sections:

- `utils: template-format` → Look for `==================== START: .bmad-1898-engineering/utils/template-format.md ====================`
- `tasks: create-story` → Look for `==================== START: .bmad-1898-engineering/tasks/create-story.md ====================`

3. **Execution Context**: You are operating in a web environment. All your capabilities and knowledge are contained within this bundle. Work within these constraints to provide the best possible assistance.

4. **Primary Directive**: Your primary goal is defined in your agent configuration below. Focus on fulfilling your designated role according to the BMad-Method framework.

# Read JIRA Ticket Task

## Purpose

Read a JIRA security alert ticket via Atlassian MCP, extract CVE IDs and affected system metadata for vulnerability analysis.

## Prerequisites

- Atlassian MCP server configured and connected
- JIRA configuration in `config.yaml` with required fields
- Valid JIRA ticket ID to read

## Configuration Requirements

This task requires JIRA configuration in `expansion-packs/bmad-1898-engineering/config.yaml`:

```yaml
jira:
  cloud_id: 'YOUR_CLOUD_ID_HERE'
  project_key: 'YOUR_PROJECT_KEY'
  custom_fields:
    cve_id: 'customfield_XXXXX'
    affected_systems: 'customfield_XXXXX'
    asset_criticality_rating: 'customfield_XXXXX'
    system_exposure: 'customfield_XXXXX'
```

## Task Steps

### Step 1: Load and Validate Configuration

1. Read the config file at `expansion-packs/bmad-1898-engineering/config.yaml`
2. Verify the `jira` section exists
3. Validate required fields are present:
   - `jira.cloud_id` - JIRA Cloud instance ID
   - `jira.project_key` - Project key (e.g., "AOD")
   - `jira.custom_fields.cve_id` - Custom field ID for CVE tracking
   - `jira.custom_fields.affected_systems` - Custom field ID for affected systems
   - `jira.custom_fields.asset_criticality_rating` - Custom field ID for criticality
   - `jira.custom_fields.system_exposure` - Custom field ID for exposure level

**If validation fails:**

- Missing config file: "❌ Config file not found at expansion-packs/bmad-1898-engineering/config.yaml"
- Missing required field: "❌ Missing required field: jira.cloud_id" (or specific field name)
- HALT and request user to configure

### Step 2: Elicit Ticket ID from User

Ask the user: **"Please provide the JIRA ticket ID to read (e.g., AOD-1234):"**

Validate format: `{PROJECT_KEY}-{NUMBER}` (e.g., AOD-1234, SEC-567)

### Step 3: Read JIRA Ticket

Use the MCP tool to fetch the ticket:

```
mcp__atlassian__getJiraIssue
  issueKey: "{user_provided_ticket_id}"
  cloudId: "{from_config.jira.cloud_id}"
```

**Handle errors gracefully:**

- **Ticket not found:** "❌ Ticket {ticket_id} not found. Verify ticket ID and try again."
- **Authentication failure:** "❌ JIRA authentication failed. Check Atlassian MCP configuration."
- **Network error:** "❌ Cannot connect to JIRA. Check network connection and try again."
- **Rate limit (429):** "⚠️ JIRA rate limit reached. Waiting 60 seconds before retry..." (See Error Recovery section below for retry logic)
- **Other errors:** "❌ Error reading ticket: {error_type}. Please try again or contact support."

If error occurs, prompt user to retry or exit.

### Step 4: Extract CVE IDs

Search for CVE IDs using pattern: `CVE-\d{4}-\d{4,7}` (case-insensitive)

**Search locations (in order):**

1. Ticket summary field: `fields.summary`
2. Ticket description field: `fields.description`
3. Custom CVE ID field: `fields[config.jira.custom_fields.cve_id]`

**Extract ALL CVE IDs found:**

- Use regex with case-insensitive flag
- Collect all matches (may find multiple)
- Designate first CVE as "primary CVE"
- Store all CVEs for processing

**Example extraction:**

```
Summary: "Apache Struts 2 RCE (CVE-2024-1234) and Log4j (CVE-2024-5678)"
Result:
  - All CVEs: [CVE-2024-1234, CVE-2024-5678]
  - Primary CVE: CVE-2024-1234
```

**If no CVE IDs found:**

- Display: "⚠️ No CVE ID found in ticket {ticket_id}."
- Prompt: "Please provide CVE ID manually, or type 'skip' to proceed with generic vulnerability research:"
- If user provides CVE: Add to CVE list as primary
- If user types 'skip': Continue without CVE (set cve_ids to empty list)
- Log warning: "WARNING: No CVE ID available for ticket {ticket_id}"

### Step 5: Extract Affected Systems Metadata

Read custom fields from the ticket response (use primary CVE for ticket-level metadata):

1. **Affected Systems:** `fields[config.jira.custom_fields.affected_systems]`
   - May be string (single system) or array (multiple systems)
   - If string: Split by comma and trim whitespace from each value
   - If null/undefined/empty: Default to empty array `[]`
   - Examples:
     - `"server-01, server-02"` → `["server-01", "server-02"]`
     - `["server-01", "server-02"]` → `["server-01", "server-02"]`
     - `null` → `[]`

2. **Asset Criticality Rating:** `fields[config.jira.custom_fields.asset_criticality_rating]`
   - Expected values: Critical, High, Medium, Low
   - If null/undefined/empty: Default to `"Unknown"`

3. **System Exposure:** `fields[config.jira.custom_fields.system_exposure]`
   - Expected values: Internet-Facing, Internal, Isolated
   - If null/undefined/empty: Default to `"Unknown"`

4. **Additional metadata from standard fields:**
   - Components: `fields.components` (array of component objects)
   - Labels: `fields.labels` (array of strings)
   - Priority: `fields.priority.name`

### Step 6: Display Summary

Present extracted information to user:

```
✅ Successfully read JIRA ticket {ticket_id}

Summary: {ticket_summary}

CVE IDs Found:
  - Primary: {primary_cve}
  - All: {cve_list}

Affected Systems: {affected_systems}
Asset Criticality: {criticality_rating}
System Exposure: {exposure_level}
Priority: {jira_priority}

Components: {components}
Labels: {labels}
```

### Step 7: Return Structured Data

Return the following data structure for use by subsequent tasks:

```yaml
ticket_id: '{ticket_id}'
summary: '{ticket_summary}'
description: '{ticket_description}'
cve_ids:
  primary: '{primary_cve}'
  all: ['{cve_1}', '{cve_2}', ...]
affected_systems: ['{system_1}', '{system_2}', ...]
asset_criticality: '{criticality_rating}'
system_exposure: '{exposure_level}'
priority: '{jira_priority}'
components: ['{component_1}', '{component_2}', ...]
labels: ['{label_1}', '{label_2}', ...]
```

## Security Considerations

**DO NOT:**

- Log JIRA credentials or API tokens
- Display cloud_id in error messages
- Expose internal system names in public logs
- Include stack traces with file paths in user-facing errors

**DO:**

- CVE IDs are public - safe to log
- Sanitize error messages
- Cache ticket data to minimize API calls
- Implement exponential backoff for retries

## Error Recovery

**Rate Limiting:**

- Implement exponential backoff: 60s, 120s, 240s
- Max 3 retries before failing

**Authentication Failures:**

- Guide user to verify MCP configuration
- Check `~/.config/mcp/config.json` or equivalent

**Network Timeouts:**

- Retry once after 30 seconds
- Offer offline mode or alternative input

## Success Criteria

Task completes successfully when:

1. ✅ Config validated and loaded
2. ✅ Ticket read from JIRA via MCP
3. ✅ At least one CVE ID extracted (or user chose to skip)
4. ✅ Affected systems metadata extracted
5. ✅ Structured data returned for next task

## Next Steps

After this task completes, the extracted data will be used by:

- CVE research tasks (enrichment via NVD/CISA)
- Risk assessment workflows
- Remediation planning
- Documentation generation

## Prerequisites

- Perplexity MCP server connected (available by default in Claude Code)
- Valid CVE identifier (CVE-YYYY-NNNNN format)
- Internet connectivity for AI-assisted research

## Configuration Requirements

No configuration required - Perplexity MCP is available by default in Claude Code.

## Task Steps

### Step 1: Elicit and Validate CVE Identifier

Ask the user: **"Please provide the CVE identifier to research (e.g., CVE-2024-1234):"**

**Validate CVE format:** `CVE-\d{4}-\d{4,7}` (case-insensitive)

**Valid examples:**

- CVE-2024-1234
- CVE-2023-44487
- CVE-2021-44228

**Invalid examples:**

- 2024-1234 (missing CVE prefix)
- CVE-24-1234 (year must be 4 digits)
- CVE-2024-123 (ID must be at least 4 digits)

**If validation fails:**

- Display: "❌ Invalid CVE format. Expected format: CVE-YYYY-NNNNN (e.g., CVE-2024-1234)"
- Re-prompt user for valid CVE identifier
- Max 3 attempts before halting

### Step 2: Construct Research Query

Build comprehensive research query requesting all required intelligence fields:

#### Query Template for Initial Research

```
Research {cve_id} comprehensive vulnerability intelligence:

REQUIRED INFORMATION:
1. CVSS Base Score and Vector String (from NIST NVD)
2. EPSS Exploitation Probability Score (from FIRST.org EPSS)
3. CISA KEV Catalog Status (Listed or Not Listed with dates)
4. Affected Product and Version Ranges (precise versions)
5. Patched Versions (if available with vendor advisory links)
6. Exploit Availability (PoC code, exploit frameworks, active exploitation)
7. MITRE ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques (with T-numbers)
8. Vendor Security Advisory Links (official vendor sites)
9. Technical Description (vulnerability mechanism and impact)
10. Attack Complexity and Prerequisites

AUTHORITATIVE SOURCES REQUIRED:
- NIST NVD (nvd.nist.gov)
- CISA KEV Catalog (cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)
- FIRST EPSS (first.org/epss)
- MITRE ATT&CK (attack.mitre.org)
- Vendor Security Advisories (official vendor sites only)

Provide specific citations with URLs for all factual claims.
Flag any information that cannot be verified from authoritative sources.
```

### Step 3: Determine Severity and Select Perplexity Tool

**Initial Research (Severity Unknown):**
Use `mcp__perplexity__reason` to get basic CVE information including CVSS score.

**Execute initial research:**

```
mcp__perplexity__reason
  query: {constructed_query}
```

**Parse CVSS score from response:**

- Extract numerical score (0.0-10.0)
- Extract severity rating (Low/Medium/High/Critical)
- If CVSS not found, default severity to "Unknown"

**Select appropriate tool based on CVSS severity:**

| CVSS Score | Severity | Perplexity Tool                  | Rationale                                  |
| ---------- | -------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 9.0 - 10.0 | Critical | `mcp__perplexity__deep_research` | Requires comprehensive 2-5 minute analysis |
| 7.0 - 8.9  | High     | `mcp__perplexity__reason`        | Requires moderate 30-60 second analysis    |
| 4.0 - 6.9  | Medium   | `mcp__perplexity__search`        | Requires basic 10-20 second lookup         |
| 0.1 - 3.9  | Low      | `mcp__perplexity__search`        | Requires quick lookup                      |
| Unknown    | Unknown  | `mcp__perplexity__reason`        | Default to moderate analysis               |

**If Critical severity detected:**

- Display: "⚠️ Critical vulnerability detected (CVSS {score}). Initiating deep research (2-5 minutes)..."
- Re-execute research with `mcp__perplexity__deep_research` for comprehensive analysis

1. Display: "⚠️ Perplexity research timed out. Retrying with simpler query..."
2. Simplify query by reducing requested fields to critical only (CVSS, EPSS, KEV)
3. Retry with next-faster tool:
   - If `deep_research` failed → Retry with `reason`
   - If `reason` failed → Retry with `search`
   - If `search` failed → Offer manual research option
4. Max 2 retries before offering manual input

**Manual research prompt:**

```
❌ Automated research failed for {cve_id}.

Options:
1. Manually provide CVSS score to continue with limited research
2. Skip research and mark vulnerability for manual analysis
3. Retry research (attempt {attempt_number}/3)

Select option (1-3):
```

### Invalid CVE Identifier

**Symptoms:**

- CVE ID not found in any vulnerability databases
- Typo in CVE identifier
- Reserved CVE number (not yet published)

**Recovery Strategy:**

1. Display: "❌ CVE {cve_id} not found in vulnerability databases."
2. Check if CVE is reserved but not published:
   - Display: "⚠️ This CVE may be reserved but not yet published."
3. Offer to correct CVE identifier:

   ```
   Options:
   1. Re-enter CVE identifier (check for typos)
   2. Research anyway (may find limited information)
   3. Exit research task

   Select option (1-3):
   ```

### Missing Critical Information

**Symptoms:**

- CVSS score not available
- CVE exists but has minimal information
- Pre-disclosure or embargoed vulnerability

**Recovery Strategy:**

1. Continue research with available information
2. Flag all missing critical fields:

   ```
   ⚠️ INCOMPLETE CVE DATA for {cve_id}

   Missing Information:
   - CVSS score not available
   - EPSS probability not calculated
   - Vendor advisory not published

   Available Information:
   - Basic CVE description
   - Affected product identified

   Recommendation: Monitor for updated CVE information
   ```

3. Return partial structured data with `null` values for missing fields
4. Set warning flag: `incomplete_data: true`

### Conflicting Source Information

**Symptoms:**

- Different CVSS scores from NVD vs vendor
- Conflicting patch version numbers
- Disputed exploitation status

**Recovery Strategy:**

1. Document all conflicting sources
2. Apply priority hierarchy:
   - **CVSS:** NVD > Vendor > Third-party
   - **Patches:** Vendor > NVD > Third-party
   - **Exploitation:** CISA > Security vendors > Researchers
3. Flag discrepancies in warnings section:

   ```
   ⚠️ CONFLICTING INFORMATION DETECTED

   CVSS Score Discrepancy:
   - NVD: 9.8 (Critical)
   - Vendor Advisory: 8.1 (High)

   Resolution: Using NVD score (9.8) as authoritative source

   Note: Review vendor advisory for additional context
   Advisory URL: {vendor_url}
   ```

4. Include all sources in structured output for manual review

### Perplexity Hallucination Detection

**Symptoms:**

- Citations to non-existent URLs
- Fabricated CVE details
- Information not verifiable from authoritative sources

**Detection Strategy:**

1. Validate all URLs are accessible (not required to fetch, just check format)
2. Cross-reference critical facts:
   - CVSS scores against known ranges (0.0-10.0)
   - CVE ID format matches pattern
   - Dates are chronologically valid
3. Flag suspicious information:

   ```
   ⚠️ UNVERIFIED INFORMATION DETECTED

   The following information could not be verified from authoritative sources:
   - ATT&CK Technique: T9999 (invalid technique number)
   - EPSS score: 1.5 (exceeds valid range 0.0-1.0)

   Action: Flagged for manual verification
   ```

**Recovery Strategy:**

1. Mark unverified data with `verified: false` flag
2. Exclude hallucinated information from structured output
3. Log warning for security analyst review
4. Suggest manual verification from authoritative sources

## Security Considerations

**DO NOT:**

- Execute exploit code or PoC scripts
- Expose internal system details in research queries
- Log API keys or credentials
- Auto-apply patches without authorization

**DO:**

- CVE IDs are public information - safe to research
- Cite all sources for audit trail
- Flag unverified information clearly
- Maintain research audit log with timestamps

## Success Criteria

Task completes successfully when:

1. ✅ CVE identifier validated
2. ✅ Research query constructed and executed
3. ✅ CVSS severity determined (or marked unknown)
4. ✅ Intelligence fields extracted (or flagged as missing)
5. ✅ Sources validated as authoritative (or flagged)
6. ✅ Structured YAML data returned
7. ✅ User presented with formatted summary

**Task may complete with warnings** - missing data or unverified information does not constitute failure.

## Next Steps

After this task completes, the structured CVE data will be used by:

- Security enrichment workflows (documentation generation)
- Priority assessment tasks (CVSS + EPSS + KEV + business context)
- JIRA ticket updates (custom field population)
- Remediation planning (patch availability and urgency)
- Threat modeling (ATT&CK mapping and attack chain analysis)

# Assess Vulnerability Priority Task

## Purpose

Calculate vulnerability remediation priority using multi-factor risk assessment combining CVSS severity, EPSS exploitation probability, CISA KEV status, asset criticality, system exposure, and exploit availability. Returns priority level (P1-P5), risk score, rationale, and SLA remediation deadline.

## Prerequisites

- Vulnerability data with CVSS score, EPSS score, KEV status, exploit status
- System context with Asset Criticality Rating (ACR) and exposure level
- CVE research completed (via `research-cve.md` task)

## Configuration Requirements

No configuration required - uses BMAD-1898 default priority framework based on CISA BOD 22-01 and NIST risk assessment principles.

**Customization:** Organizations can override priority thresholds and SLA timelines in `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml` (optional).

## Task Steps

### Step 1: Validate Input Data

**Required vulnerability data:**

- `cvss_score` (float): CVSS base score 0.0-10.0
- `epss_score` (float): EPSS probability 0.0-1.0
- `kev_status` (string): "Listed" or "Not Listed"
- `exploit_status` (string): "Active Exploitation", "Public Exploit", "PoC", or "Theoretical"

**Required system data:**

- `acr_rating` (string): "Critical", "High", "Medium", or "Low"
- `exposure` (string): "Internet", "Internal", or "Isolated"

**Validation rules:**

- CVSS score must be 0.0-10.0 (default to 0.0 if missing)
- EPSS score must be 0.0-1.0 (default to 0.0 if missing)
- KEV status must be "Listed" or "Not Listed" (default to "Not Listed" if missing)
- ACR rating must be valid enum value (default to "Medium" if missing)
- Exposure must be valid enum value (default to "Internal" if missing)
- Exploit status must be valid enum value (default to "Theoretical" if missing)

**If critical data missing:**

- Display: "⚠️ Missing vulnerability data: {missing_fields}"
- Continue with default values
- Flag assessment as "INCOMPLETE DATA" in rationale

### Step 2: Calculate Factor Scores

Calculate score (0-5 points) for each of 6 risk factors:

#### Factor 1: CVSS Severity (0-4 points)

**Scoring algorithm:**

```
if cvss_score >= 9.0:
    cvss_points = 4  # Critical severity
elif cvss_score >= 7.0:
    cvss_points = 3  # High severity
elif cvss_score >= 4.0:
    cvss_points = 2  # Medium severity
else:
    cvss_points = 1  # Low severity
```

**Interpretation:**

- 9.0-10.0 (Critical): Severe impact, complete system compromise possible
- 7.0-8.9 (High): Significant impact, partial system compromise possible
- 4.0-6.9 (Medium): Moderate impact, limited scope
- 0.1-3.9 (Low): Minimal impact, difficult to exploit

#### Factor 2: EPSS Exploitation Probability (0-4 points)

**Scoring algorithm:**

```
if epss_score >= 0.75:
    epss_points = 4  # Very high probability
elif epss_score >= 0.50:
    epss_points = 3  # High probability
elif epss_score >= 0.25:
    epss_points = 2  # Moderate probability
else:
    epss_points = 1  # Low probability
```

**Interpretation:**

- 0.75-1.00 (Very High): ≥75% likelihood of exploitation within 30 days
- 0.50-0.74 (High): 50-74% likelihood of exploitation
- 0.25-0.49 (Moderate): 25-49% likelihood of exploitation
- 0.00-0.24 (Low): <25% likelihood of exploitation

#### Factor 3: CISA KEV Status (0-5 points, OVERRIDE)

**Scoring algorithm:**

```
if kev_status == "Listed":
    kev_points = 5  # Automatic high priority (override)
else:
    kev_points = 0  # No bonus
```

**Interpretation:**

- **Listed:** CISA has confirmed active exploitation in the wild
  - **CRITICAL:** KEV listing is an override factor - automatically elevates priority
  - Per CISA BOD 22-01: Federal agencies must remediate KEV vulnerabilities within mandated timelines
- **Not Listed:** No confirmed widespread exploitation (proceed with normal scoring)

**KEV Override Rule:**
If `kev_points == 5`, vulnerability receives minimum P1 or P2 priority regardless of other factors.

#### Factor 4: Asset Criticality Rating - ACR (0-4 points)

**Scoring algorithm:**

```
acr_map = {
    "Critical": 4,  # Mission-critical systems
    "High": 3,      # Important business systems
    "Medium": 2,    # Standard systems
    "Low": 1        # Dev/test systems
}
acr_points = acr_map.get(acr_rating, 2)  # Default to Medium
```

**Interpretation:**

- **Critical (4 pts):** Mission-critical production systems
  - Examples: Payment processing, authentication servers, production databases
  - Impact: Business-critical outage, data breach, compliance violation
- **High (3 pts):** Important business systems
  - Examples: CRM, ERP, customer portals, internal apps
  - Impact: Significant business disruption
- **Medium (2 pts):** Standard business systems
  - Examples: Internal tools, reporting systems, wikis
  - Impact: Operational inconvenience
- **Low (1 pt):** Non-production systems
  - Examples: Development, test, sandbox environments
  - Impact: Minimal business impact

#### Factor 5: System Exposure (0-3 points)

**Scoring algorithm:**

```
exposure_map = {
    "Internet": 3,   # Public-facing
    "Internal": 2,   # Internal network only
    "Isolated": 1    # Air-gapped/DMZ
}
exposure_points = exposure_map.get(exposure, 2)  # Default to Internal
```

**Interpretation:**

- **Internet-Facing (3 pts):** Directly accessible from public internet
  - Attack surface: Maximum (anyone can attempt exploitation)
  - Examples: Web servers, APIs, VPNs, public cloud services
- **Internal Network (2 pts):** Accessible only from corporate network
  - Attack surface: Limited to internal users or compromised systems
  - Examples: Internal apps, file servers, databases on private network
- **Isolated (1 pt):** Air-gapped, DMZ, or highly restricted access
  - Attack surface: Minimal (requires physical access or multi-step compromise)
  - Examples: OT/ICS systems, air-gapped networks, bastion hosts

#### Factor 6: Exploit Availability (0-4 points)

**Scoring algorithm:**

```
exploit_map = {
    "Active Exploitation": 4,  # In-the-wild exploitation confirmed
    "Public Exploit": 3,       # Exploit code publicly available
    "PoC": 2,                  # Proof-of-concept exists
    "Theoretical": 1           # No known exploit
}
exploit_points = exploit_map.get(exploit_status, 1)  # Default to Theoretical
```

**Interpretation:**

- **Active Exploitation (4 pts):** Confirmed in-the-wild exploitation
  - Evidence: Threat intel reports, IDS alerts, honeypot observations
  - Risk: Imminent threat, attackers actively targeting this vulnerability
- **Public Exploit (3 pts):** Weaponized exploit code publicly available
  - Sources: ExploitDB, Metasploit, GitHub, security researcher disclosures
  - Risk: Low skill barrier, any attacker can exploit
- **PoC (2 pts):** Proof-of-concept demonstration exists
  - Sources: Research papers, vendor advisories, conference talks
  - Risk: Requires modification to weaponize, moderate skill barrier
- **Theoretical (1 pt):** No known exploit code or demonstration
  - Risk: Requires expert-level skill to develop exploit

### Step 3: Calculate Total Risk Score

**Sum all factor scores:**

```
total_score = cvss_points + epss_points + kev_points + acr_points + exposure_points + exploit_points
```

**Score range:** 0-24 points maximum

- CVSS: 0-4 points
- EPSS: 0-4 points
- KEV: 0-5 points (override factor)
- ACR: 0-4 points
- Exposure: 0-3 points
- Exploit: 0-4 points

**Score distribution examples:**

- **Maximum (24 pts):** CVSS 10.0 + EPSS 1.0 + KEV Listed + Critical ACR + Internet + Active Exploitation
- **Minimum (6 pts):** CVSS 0.0 + EPSS 0.0 + No KEV + Low ACR + Isolated + Theoretical

### Step 4: Map Score to Priority Level

**Priority mapping algorithm:**

```
if total_score >= 20 or kev_points == 5:
    priority = "P1"         # Critical
    sla_hours = 24
elif total_score >= 15:
    priority = "P2"         # High
    sla_hours = 168         # 7 days
elif total_score >= 10:
    priority = "P3"         # Medium
    sla_hours = 720         # 30 days
elif total_score >= 5:
    priority = "P4"         # Low
    sla_hours = 2160        # 90 days
else:
    priority = "P5"         # Informational
    sla_hours = None        # No SLA
```

**Priority definitions:**

**P1 - Critical (24 hour SLA):**

- **Score threshold:** ≥20 points OR KEV Listed
- **Criteria:** Severe vulnerabilities with imminent exploitation risk
- **Examples:**
  - CVSS 9.8 + EPSS 0.85 + KEV Listed + Critical ACR + Internet-Facing
  - Active exploitation of internet-facing production system
- **Action:** Emergency patching, war room, executive notification

**P2 - High (7 day SLA):**

- **Score threshold:** 15-19 points
- **Criteria:** High severity with significant exploitation risk
- **Examples:**
  - CVSS 8.0 + EPSS 0.60 + Public Exploit + High ACR + Internal
  - High severity with public PoC affecting important systems
- **Action:** Urgent patching within next sprint, escalate to security team

**P3 - Medium (30 day SLA):**

- **Score threshold:** 10-14 points
- **Criteria:** Moderate severity with limited exploitation risk
- **Examples:**
  - CVSS 6.5 + EPSS 0.30 + No Exploit + Medium ACR + Internal
  - Moderate severity affecting internal systems with no known exploits
- **Action:** Planned patching in regular maintenance window

**P4 - Low (90 day SLA):**

- **Score threshold:** 5-9 points
- **Criteria:** Low severity or low-criticality systems
- **Examples:**
  - CVSS 3.5 + EPSS 0.10 + Theoretical + Low ACR + Isolated
  - Low severity on development systems with theoretical risk
- **Action:** Routine patching during scheduled maintenance

**P5 - Informational (No SLA):**

- **Score threshold:** 0-4 points
- **Criteria:** Minimal risk, awareness only
- **Examples:**
  - CVSS 1.5 + EPSS 0.05 + No Exploit + Test Environment
  - Theoretical vulnerabilities with minimal business impact
- **Action:** Awareness only, optional patching, document as accepted risk

### Step 5: Apply Priority Modifiers (Override Rules)

**Automatic P1 override (regardless of calculated score):**

- KEV Listed + Internet-Facing + Critical ACR
- Active Exploitation + CVSS ≥9.0 + High ACR

**Priority elevation (+1 level):**

- Compliance requirement (PCI-DSS, HIPAA, SOX, etc.)
- Previous security incident involving similar vulnerability
- Executive risk acceptance required but not granted
- Customer-facing system with data breach potential

**Priority reduction (-1 level):**

- Effective compensating controls validated by security team
  - Examples: WAF rules blocking exploit, network segmentation preventing access
  - **Requirement:** Documented and tested compensating control
- System scheduled for decommission within 30 days
  - **Requirement:** Confirmed decommission date and migration plan
- Vendor end-of-life with no patch available
  - **Requirement:** Documented mitigation or replacement plan

**Modifier application logic:**

```
# Apply overrides first
if (kev_status == "Listed" and exposure == "Internet" and acr_rating == "Critical"):
    priority = "P1"
elif (exploit_status == "Active Exploitation" and cvss_score >= 9.0 and acr_rating in ["Critical", "High"]):
    priority = "P1"

# Apply elevations
if has_compliance_requirement and priority != "P1":
    priority = elevate_priority(priority)  # P2→P1, P3→P2, etc.

# Apply reductions
if has_compensating_controls and priority != "P5":
    priority = reduce_priority(priority)  # P2→P3, P3→P4, etc.
```

**Document all modifiers applied in rationale.**

### Step 6: Calculate SLA Deadline

**SLA calculation algorithm:**

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def calculate_sla_deadline(enrichment_timestamp, sla_hours):
    """Calculate exact SLA remediation deadline"""

    if sla_hours is None:
        return "No SLA (Informational)"

    # Calculate deadline
    deadline = enrichment_timestamp + timedelta(hours=sla_hours)

    # Format: "2025-11-08 14:30:00 UTC (24 hours from enrichment)"
    hours_label = f"{sla_hours} hours" if sla_hours < 48 else f"{sla_hours // 24} days"
    return f"{deadline.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S UTC')} ({hours_label} from enrichment)"
```

**SLA timeline mapping:**

- **P1:** 24 hours from enrichment timestamp
- **P2:** 168 hours (7 days) from enrichment timestamp
- **P3:** 720 hours (30 days) from enrichment timestamp
- **P4:** 2160 hours (90 days) from enrichment timestamp
- **P5:** No SLA (informational only)

**SLA warnings:**

- Display breach warning if current time > 80% of SLA window
- Escalate if SLA already breached

### Step 7: Generate Priority Rationale

**Rationale template:**

```markdown
## Priority Assessment

**Priority Level:** {priority} - {priority_label}
**Overall Risk Score:** {total_score}/24 points
**SLA Remediation Deadline:** {sla_deadline}

### Factor Analysis

**1. CVSS Severity:** {cvss_score} ({cvss_severity}) → {cvss_points}/4 points

- Vulnerability has {cvss_interpretation}

**2. EPSS Exploitation Probability:** {epss_score} ({epss_percentile}th percentile) → {epss_points}/4 points

- {epss_interpretation}

**3. CISA KEV Status:** {kev_status} → {kev_points}/5 points

- {kev_interpretation}

**4. Asset Criticality Rating:** {acr_rating} → {acr_points}/4 points

- System is {acr_interpretation}

**5. System Exposure:** {exposure} → {exposure_points}/3 points

- System is {exposure_interpretation}

**6. Exploit Availability:** {exploit_status} → {exploit_points}/4 points

{modifiers_applied}

### Recommended Actions

**Immediate Actions:**
{priority_specific_actions}

**Remediation Guidance:**
{remediation_guidance}
```

**Rationale explanation logic:**

```
if priority == "P1":
    explanation = "This vulnerability represents a CRITICAL risk requiring immediate emergency response. "
    if kev_points == 5:
        explanation += "CISA has confirmed active exploitation in the wild (KEV Listed). "
    explanation += f"The combination of {highlight_top_factors} creates an imminent threat to {acr_rating.lower()} systems."

elif priority == "P2":
    explanation = "This vulnerability represents a HIGH risk requiring urgent remediation. "

    explanation = "This vulnerability represents a LOW risk for routine patching. "
    explanation += f"The {cvss_severity} severity and {highlight_low_risk_factors} indicate limited business impact."

else:  # P5
    explanation = "This vulnerability is INFORMATIONAL only with minimal risk. "
    explanation += f"The {cvss_severity} severity and {highlight_minimal_factors} result in negligible business impact."

## Error Handling

### Missing Vulnerability Data

**Symptoms:**

- CVSS score not available
- EPSS score not calculated
- KEV status unknown
- Exploit status unclear

**Recovery Strategy:**

1. Apply default values for missing fields:
   - CVSS: 0.0 (minimal severity)
   - EPSS: 0.0 (minimal probability)
   - KEV: "Not Listed"
   - Exploit: "Theoretical"
2. Flag assessment as incomplete:

   ```
   ⚠️ INCOMPLETE ASSESSMENT DATA

   Missing Fields:
   - CVSS score not available (defaulted to 0.0)
   - EPSS probability not calculated (defaulted to 0.0)

   Recommendation: Complete CVE research before relying on priority assessment
   ```

3. Continue with assessment using available data
4. Document data gaps in metadata: `data_completeness: "INCOMPLETE - missing CVSS, EPSS"`
5. Recommend re-assessment once missing data obtained

### Missing System Context

**Symptoms:**

- ACR rating not defined
- System exposure level unknown
- System criticality unclear

**Recovery Strategy:**

1. Prompt user for missing system context:

   ```
   ⚠️ System context required for accurate priority assessment

   Please provide:
   1. Asset Criticality Rating (Critical/High/Medium/Low): _______
   2. System Exposure (Internet/Internal/Isolated): _______

   Or type 'default' to use conservative estimates (Medium ACR, Internal exposure)
   ```

2. If user selects 'default', apply conservative defaults:
   - ACR: "Medium" (standard system)
   - Exposure: "Internal" (not internet-facing)
3. Document assumptions in rationale
4. Flag for manual review: "Assessment based on assumed system context"

### Invalid Input Values

**Symptoms:**

- CVSS score >10.0 or <0.0
- EPSS score outside 0.0-1.0 range
- Unrecognized enum values

**Recovery Strategy:**

1. Validate all inputs before processing
2. For invalid numerical values:

   ```
   ❌ Invalid CVSS score: {value}

   CVSS score must be between 0.0 and 10.0
   Please verify CVE research data and retry
   ```

3. For invalid enum values:

   ```
   ❌ Invalid ACR rating: "{value}"

   Valid options: Critical, High, Medium, Low
   Please provide valid rating or type 'help' for definitions
   ```

4. Max 3 retry attempts before offering default values
5. Do not proceed with assessment if critical validation fails

### SLA Already Breached

**Symptoms:**

- Current timestamp > SLA deadline
- Vulnerability past remediation timeline

**Recovery Strategy:**

1. Calculate breach duration:
   ```python
   breach_hours = (current_time - sla_deadline).total_seconds() / 3600
   ```
2. Display prominent breach warning:

   ```
   🚨 SLA BREACH WARNING 🚨

   This {priority} vulnerability is OVERDUE for remediation!

   Original SLA: {sla_hours} hours
   Breach Duration: {breach_hours} hours PAST deadline
   Original Deadline: {sla_deadline}

   IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:
   - Escalate to security management
   - Document delay reason
   - Expedite remediation or request risk acceptance
   ```

3. Flag in output: `sla_breach_warning: true`
4. Recommend immediate escalation to security leadership

### Conflicting Priority Factors

**Symptoms:**

- High CVSS but low EPSS
- KEV Listed but isolated system
- Critical ACR but low CVSS

**Recovery Strategy:**

1. Document conflict in rationale:

   ```
   ⚠️ CONFLICTING RISK FACTORS DETECTED

   High Severity Factors:
   - CVSS: 9.8 (Critical severity)
   - System: Critical ACR

   Low Urgency Factors:
   - EPSS: 0.05 (Low exploitation probability)
   - Exposure: Isolated (not internet-facing)

   Resolution: Priority calculated using multi-factor scoring algorithm
   Result: P2 (High) - Critical severity offset by low exploitation risk

   Recommendation: Monitor threat intelligence for EPSS changes
   ```

2. Highlight conflicting factors in factor breakdown
3. Explain priority decision logic clearly
4. Recommend periodic re-assessment if threat landscape changes

## Security Considerations

**DO NOT:**

- Store priority assessments with hardcoded credentials or sensitive system details
- Expose internal system architecture in priority rationale
- Auto-apply patches without authorization
- Share priority assessments outside authorized security team

**DO:**

- Document all priority modifiers and override decisions
- Maintain audit trail of priority assessments with timestamps
- Flag SLA breaches for escalation
- Re-assess priorities when new threat intelligence available
- Use priority assessments to inform risk-based patching strategies

**Audit Trail Requirements:**

- Log all priority assessments with timestamp, user, and input data
- Track priority changes over time (vulnerability aging)
- Document all manual overrides and business justifications
- Retain assessment history for compliance reporting

## Success Criteria

Task completes successfully when:

1. ✅ Input data validated (or defaults applied with warnings)
2. ✅ All 6 factor scores calculated
3. ✅ Total risk score computed (0-24 points)
4. ✅ Priority level assigned (P1-P5)
5. ✅ Priority modifiers evaluated and applied
6. ✅ SLA deadline calculated
7. ✅ Comprehensive rationale generated
8. ✅ Structured assessment data returned (YAML)
9. ✅ Summary displayed to user

**Task may complete with warnings** - incomplete data or missing context does not constitute failure if documented appropriately.

## Next Steps

After priority assessment, structured data will be used by:

- **JIRA Update Tasks:** Populate custom fields (Priority, Risk Score, SLA Deadline)
- **Enrichment Documentation:** Include priority rationale in security analysis comments
- **Remediation Planning:** Schedule patching based on priority level and SLA
- **Metrics & Reporting:** Track vulnerability aging, SLA compliance, remediation velocity
- **Risk Dashboards:** Visualize vulnerability portfolio by priority distribution
- **Compliance Reporting:** Demonstrate risk-based vulnerability management for audits

**Integration with Security Analyst Agent:**
The Security Analyst agent invokes this task via the `*assess-priority {ticket-id}` command, passing vulnerability and system context data from prior CVE research and JIRA ticket analysis.

# Create Document from Template (YAML Driven)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION NOTICE ⚠️

**THIS IS AN EXECUTABLE WORKFLOW - NOT REFERENCE MATERIAL**

When this task is invoked:

1. **DISABLE ALL EFFICIENCY OPTIMIZATIONS** - This workflow requires full user interaction
2. **MANDATORY STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION** - Each section must be processed sequentially with user feedback
3. **ELICITATION IS REQUIRED** - When `elicit: true`, you MUST use the 1-9 format and wait for user response
4. **NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED** - Complete documents cannot be created without following this workflow

**VIOLATION INDICATOR:** If you create a complete document without user interaction, you have violated this workflow.

## Critical: Template Discovery

If a YAML Template has not been provided, list all templates from .bmad-core/templates or ask the user to provide another.

## CRITICAL: Mandatory Elicitation Format

**When `elicit: true`, this is a HARD STOP requiring user interaction:**

**YOU MUST:**

1. Present section content
2. Provide detailed rationale (explain trade-offs, assumptions, decisions made)
3. **STOP and present numbered options 1-9:**
   - **Option 1:** Always "Proceed to next section"
   - **Options 2-9:** Select 8 methods from data/elicitation-methods
   - End with: "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"
4. **WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE** - Do not proceed until user selects option or provides feedback

**WORKFLOW VIOLATION:** Creating content for elicit=true sections without user interaction violates this task.

**NEVER ask yes/no questions or use any other format.**

## Processing Flow

1. **Parse YAML template** - Load template metadata and sections
2. **Set preferences** - Show current mode (Interactive), confirm output file
3. **Process each section:**
   - Skip if condition unmet
   - Check agent permissions (owner/editors) - note if section is restricted to specific agents
   - Draft content using section instruction
   - Present content + detailed rationale
   - **IF elicit: true** → MANDATORY 1-9 options format
   - Save to file if possible
4. **Continue until complete**

## Detailed Rationale Requirements

When presenting section content, ALWAYS include rationale that explains:

- Trade-offs and choices made (what was chosen over alternatives and why)
- Key assumptions made during drafting
- Interesting or questionable decisions that need user attention
- Areas that might need validation

## Elicitation Results Flow

After user selects elicitation method (2-9):

1. Execute method from data/elicitation-methods
2. Present results with insights
3. Offer options:
   - **1. Apply changes and update section**
   - **2. Return to elicitation menu**
   - **3. Ask any questions or engage further with this elicitation**

## Agent Permissions

When processing sections with agent permission fields:

- **owner**: Note which agent role initially creates/populates the section
- **editors**: List agent roles allowed to modify the section
- **readonly**: Mark sections that cannot be modified after creation

**For sections with restricted access:**

- Include a note in the generated document indicating the responsible agent
- Example: "_(This section is owned by dev-agent and can only be modified by dev-agent)_"

## YOLO Mode

User can type `#yolo` to toggle to YOLO mode (process all sections at once).

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

**❌ NEVER:**

- Ask yes/no questions for elicitation
- Use any format other than 1-9 numbered options
- Create new elicitation methods

**✅ ALWAYS:**

- Use exact 1-9 format when elicit: true
- Select options 2-9 from data/elicitation-methods only
- Provide detailed rationale explaining decisions
- End with "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"

## 1. Introduction

BMAD-1898 is an AI-assisted security vulnerability enrichment and quality assurance expansion pack for the BMAD Method™ framework. It addresses the challenge of 50,000+ annual CVE disclosures by enabling analysts to enrich vulnerability tickets 90% faster while maintaining enterprise-grade quality through systematic peer review.

**Key Components:**

- Security Analyst Agent: AI-assisted enrichment
- Security Reviewer Agent: Systematic QA review
- 8 Quality Dimension Checklists
- Multi-Factor Risk Assessment Framework

---

## 2. Vulnerability Management Landscape

### Current Challenge (2025)

**CVE Volume (Source: NIST NVD historical trends, verify during implementation):**

- 2024: 43,000+ CVE disclosures (approximate)
- 2025: 50,000+ projected (18% increase estimate)
- 2030: 75,000+ estimated (trend extrapolation)

**Alert Fatigue (Source: Industry benchmarks - verify current statistics during implementation):**

- 78% of security alerts go uninvestigated (industry estimate)
- Average analyst processes 10-20 alerts/day manually (typical capacity)
- With AI assistance: 50-100 alerts/day possible (performance goal)

**Traditional CVSS-Only Approach:**

- Problem: CVSS only measures severity, not exploitability
- Result: Patching theoretical risks while missing genuine threats
- Example: CVSS 9.8 vulnerability with EPSS 0.02 (low exploitation probability)

**BMAD-1898 Solution:**

- Multi-factor risk assessment (CVSS + EPSS + KEV + Business Context)
- AI-assisted research (10-15 min vs. hours - performance target)
- Systematic QA (60-70% more defects found - based on dual-review effectiveness studies)

---

## 3. Frameworks and Standards

### 3.1 NIST NVD (National Vulnerability Database)

**Purpose:** Authoritative source for CVE details, CVSS scores, affected products

**URL:** https://nvd.nist.gov

**CVE ID Format:** CVE-YYYY-NNNNN

- YYYY: Year of disclosure
- NNNNN: 4-7 digit identifier
- Example: CVE-2024-1234

**Information Provided:**

- CVE description
- CVSS v3.1 base score and vector
- Affected products and versions
- References (vendor advisories, exploits)
- CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration)

**Update Frequency:** Real-time (hours after disclosure)

---

### 3.2 CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)

**Purpose:** Standardized severity scoring (0.0-10.0)

**Version:** CVSS v3.1 (current standard)

**Base Score Metrics:**

- **AV (Attack Vector):** Network/Adjacent/Local/Physical
- **AC (Attack Complexity):** Low/High
- **PR (Privileges Required):** None/Low/High
- **UI (User Interaction):** None/Required
- **S (Scope):** Unchanged/Changed
- **C (Confidentiality Impact):** None/Low/High
- **I (Integrity Impact):** None/Low/High
- **A (Availability Impact):** None/Low/High

**Vector String Example:**
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**Severity Ratings:**

- 0.0: None
- 0.1-3.9: Low
- 4.0-6.9: Medium
- 7.0-8.9: High
- 9.0-10.0: Critical

**Limitation:** CVSS measures severity, NOT exploitability

---

### 3.3 EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System)

**Purpose:** Data-driven exploitation probability prediction

**URL:** https://www.first.org/epss

**Score Range:** 0.0 - 1.0 (0% to 100% probability)

**Percentile:** Ranks vulnerability against all CVEs

**Understanding EPSS Scores:**

EPSS provides two values:

- **Score (0.0-1.0)**: Probability of exploitation (e.g., 0.85 = 85% probability)
- **Percentile**: Ranking against all CVEs (e.g., 85th percentile = scores higher than 85% of CVEs)

**BMAD-1898 Interpretation Guidance:**

- 0.00-0.25: Low exploitation probability
- 0.26-0.49: Moderate exploitation probability
- 0.50-0.75: High exploitation probability
- 0.76-1.00: Very high exploitation probability

**Example:**

- CVE-2024-5678: EPSS Score 0.85, Percentile 92.5
- Meaning: 85% probability of exploitation within 30 days
- Context: Scores higher than 92.5% of all CVEs (top 7.5% most likely to be exploited)

**Update Frequency:** Daily

**Why EPSS Matters:**

- Many CVSS 9.0+ vulnerabilities have EPSS <0.10 (rarely exploited)
- Some CVSS 6.0 vulnerabilities have EPSS >0.80 (frequently exploited)
- EPSS + CVSS provides complete risk picture

---

### 3.4 CISA KEV (Known Exploited Vulnerabilities)

**Purpose:** Catalog of vulnerabilities actively exploited in the wild

**URL:** https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog

**Listing Criteria:**

- Assigned CVE ID
- Reliable evidence of active exploitation
- Clear remediation action available

**KEV Fields:**

- CVE ID
- Date Added to KEV
- Due Date (Federal agencies must remediate by this date)
- Required Action
- Vendor/Project
- Known Ransomware Campaign Use

**Why KEV Matters:**

- CISA observes active exploitation
- Federal mandates require KEV vulnerabilities patched within timelines
- Strong signal for prioritization (should be P1 or P2)

**Example:**

- CVE-2024-1234 added to KEV on 2024-11-01
- Due Date: 2024-11-22 (21 days)
- Required Action: Apply updates per vendor instructions

---

### 3.5 Asset Criticality Rating (ACR)

**Purpose:** Business impact classification for systems

**Ratings:**

- **Critical:** Mission-critical systems (production databases, payment systems, authentication servers)
- **High:** Important business systems (CRM, ERP, customer portals)
- **Medium:** Standard business systems (internal tools, reporting)
- **Low:** Development, test, or non-production systems

**Assessment Factors:**

- Business process dependency
- Data sensitivity
- Downtime impact
- Regulatory requirements
- Customer impact

**Example:**

- Production payment processing server: Critical
- Internal wiki: Medium
- Dev sandbox: Low

---

## 4. Risk Assessment Methodology

### Multi-Factor Priority Framework

**Framework Design Basis:** This priority framework combines CISA BOD 22-01 requirements, NIST risk assessment principles, and industry best practices for vulnerability management. SLA timelines align with common enterprise security operations standards.

BMAD-1898 uses a **multi-factor risk assessment** approach combining:

1. **CVSS Score** (Severity)
2. **EPSS Score** (Exploitability)
3. **CISA KEV Status** (Active Exploitation)
4. **Asset Criticality Rating** (Business Impact)
5. **System Exposure** (Internet/Internal/Isolated)
6. **Exploit Availability** (PoC/Public/Active)

### Priority Levels (P1-P5)

**Note:** The priority criteria and SLA timelines below are BMAD-1898 recommendations based on industry-standard practices. Organizations should adjust thresholds, factor weights, and timelines based on their specific risk tolerance and operational capabilities.

**P1 - Critical (24 hour SLA):**

- Criteria: CVSS ≥9.0 + EPSS ≥0.75 + KEV Listed, OR Active Exploitation + Internet-Facing + Critical ACR
- Example: RCE in internet-facing production database with active exploitation
- Action: Emergency patching, war room if needed

**P2 - High (7 day SLA):**

## 5. Remediation Strategies

### 5.1 Patching (Preferred)

**When:** Vendor patch available

**Actions:**

- Identify patched version
- Review patch release notes
- Test in non-production
- Schedule deployment
- Verify patch applied successfully

**Priority:** Always preferred over workarounds

---

### 5.2 Workarounds (Temporary)

**When:** No patch available yet, vendor provides workaround

**Actions:**

- Implement vendor-recommended workaround
- Document workaround steps
- Monitor for patch availability
- Plan to remove workaround once patched

**Example:** Disable vulnerable feature until patch available

---

### 5.3 Compensating Controls (Mitigation)

**When:** Patching delayed, need to reduce risk

**Actions:**

- WAF rules to block exploitation attempts
- Network segmentation to limit exposure
- IDS/IPS signatures to detect exploitation
- Enhanced logging and monitoring
- Access restrictions

**Note:** Controls mitigate but don't eliminate vulnerability

---

### 5.4 System Isolation (Containment)

**When:** Critical vulnerability, no patch, high exploitation risk

**Actions:**

- Remove system from network
- Restrict access to trusted users only
- Implement compensating controls
- Plan replacement or rebuild

---

### 5.5 Risk Acceptance (Documented Decision)

**When:** Remediation cost exceeds risk, or system decommissioning soon

**Actions:**

- Document risk acceptance decision
- Obtain management approval
- Implement monitoring
- Set review date
- Plan eventual remediation or decommissioning

---

# BMAD-1898 Priority Framework

## Introduction

The BMAD-1898 Priority Framework uses **multi-factor risk assessment** to prioritize vulnerabilities based on genuine exploitable threat, not severity alone. This approach reduces alert fatigue by focusing remediation efforts on vulnerabilities that pose real risk.

**Core Principle:** CVSS + EPSS + KEV + Business Context = Accurate Priority

---

### Automatic Priority Elevation (+1 or +2 levels)

**Compliance Requirement:**

- PCI-DSS Critical vulnerability: Elevate to P1 or P2
- HIPAA-regulated system: Elevate +1 level

**Previous Breach:**

- Similar vulnerability exploited in past: Elevate +1 level
- Same product/vendor as previous breach: Elevate +1 level

**Executive Mandate:**

- CEO/CIO/CISO mandate: Elevate to specified priority
- Board-level concern: Elevate to P1 or P2

**Ransomware Threat:**

- KEV with known ransomware use: Elevate to P1

---

### Priority Reduction (-1 level)

**Effective Compensating Controls:**

- WAF with virtual patching: Reduce -1 level
- Network segmentation isolates vulnerable system: Reduce -1 level
- System not accessible to attackers: Reduce -1 level

**Scheduled Decommissioning:**

- System decommissioning within 30 days: Reduce to P5
- System decommissioning within 90 days: Reduce -1 level

**Vendor End-of-Life (No Patch):**

- No patch available, vendor EOL: Consider risk acceptance (P5)
- Migration to supported version planned: Maintain current priority

## SLA Enforcement

### SLA Deadlines

| Priority | SLA Timeline | Calculation                     |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| P1       | 24 hours     | Enrichment timestamp + 24 hours |
| P2       | 7 days       | Enrichment timestamp + 7 days   |
| P3       | 30 days      | Enrichment timestamp + 30 days  |
| P4       | 90 days      | Enrichment timestamp + 90 days  |
| P5       | No SLA       | N/A                             |

### SLA Tracking

**Deadline Calculation Example:**

- Enrichment completed: 2025-11-06 10:30:00 UTC
- Priority: P1 (24 hours)
- SLA Deadline: 2025-11-07 10:30:00 UTC

**SLA Breach:**

- Definition: Remediation not completed by deadline
- Action: Escalate to management, document reason for delay
