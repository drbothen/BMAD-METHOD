# Additional context
review_notes: |
  STRENGTHS:
  - Comprehensive coverage of all 6 acceptance criteria
  - Accurate 8-dimension framework documentation (correct weights, checklists, methodology)
  - Excellent blameless review principles with language transformation examples
  - Professional writing quality with clear organization and consistent formatting
  - Strong UX features (Quick Start Guide, FAQ, troubleshooting)
  - Correct cognitive bias types matching actual implementation
  - Well-structured examples demonstrating blameless culture effectively

  ISSUE:
  - Example quality scores calculated independently without matching story targets
  - Creates inconsistency between story requirements and implementation
  - Easily correctable with 15-20 minute adjustment

  ASSESSMENT:
  This is exemplary documentation work. The single accuracy gap is a minor discrepancy
  that doesn't diminish the overall excellence of the deliverable. Documentation is
  production-ready and usable as-is, but correction recommended for integrity.

  COMMENDATIONS:
  - Thorough research and accurate technical representation
  - Excellent user-focused organization
  - Strong demonstration of blameless review culture
  - Consistent formatting and professional writing
