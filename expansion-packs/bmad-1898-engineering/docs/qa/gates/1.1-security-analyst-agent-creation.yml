# Recommendations
recommendations:
  immediate: []  # No immediate actions required
  future:
    - action: "Consider updating customization field to explicit null value for consistency with QA agent pattern"
      refs: ["agents/security-analyst.md:39"]
      priority: low
      rationale: "Current form is acceptable but less explicit. Optional enhancement for pattern consistency."
    - action: "Add automated agent activation tests as expansion pack matures"
      refs: ["expansion-packs/bmad-1898-engineering/tests/agents/"]
      priority: medium
      rationale: "Manual testing is acceptable for v0.1.0 but automation recommended for future releases."
    - action: "Integration testing with JIRA sandbox when implementing story 1.2"
      refs: ["docs/stories/1.2.jira-ticket-reading.md"]
      priority: high
      rationale: "Planned work to validate MCP integration."
