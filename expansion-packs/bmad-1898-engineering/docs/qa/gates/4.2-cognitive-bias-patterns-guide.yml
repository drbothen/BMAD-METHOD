# Recommendations
recommendations:
  immediate: []  # No must-fix items before production
  future:  # Optional enhancements for future iteration
    - action: "Add objective scoring instructions to self-assessment guide"
      rationale: "Current tool relies on analyst recall which could introduce recollection bias. Structured scoring guidance would improve objectivity."
      refs: ["data/cognitive-bias-patterns.md:279-311"]
      priority: "low"
    - action: "Include timeline guidance for re-assessment"
      rationale: "Adding re-assessment intervals (e.g., 'monthly' or 'after 30 days') would help analysts track improvement over time"
      refs: ["data/cognitive-bias-patterns.md:313-327"]
      priority: "low"
    - action: "Add scoring examples to reduce interpretation variability"
      rationale: "Concrete examples of how to count 'Yes' answers would standardize self-assessment across analysts"
      refs: ["data/cognitive-bias-patterns.md:279-311"]
      priority: "low"
    - action: "Execute validation testing with 2-3 security analysts"
      rationale: "Story includes comprehensive test plan (Test Cases 1-3) that should be executed to validate guide effectiveness before marking Done"
      refs: ["docs/stories/4.2.cognitive-bias-patterns-guide.md:417-447"]
      priority: "medium"

# Detailed findings
findings:
  strengths:
    - "All 5 bias types comprehensively covered with consistent structure (Definition → Psychology → Examples → Impact → Techniques)"
    - "Security examples are realistic and technically accurate, properly referencing CVSS/EPSS/KEV frameworks from Story 4.1"
    - "Debiasing techniques are specific and actionable (20 techniques total, 4 per bias)"
    - "Perfect adherence to formatting standards (proper emoji usage, heading hierarchy, horizontal rules)"
    - "Self-assessment tool provides clear 3-tier scoring system with actionable recommendations"
    - "Content is well-researched and grounded in established cognitive psychology"

  areas_for_enhancement:
    - "Self-assessment scoring could be more objective with structured counting guidance"
    - "Re-assessment timeline would help analysts measure improvement"
    - "Scoring examples would reduce interpretation variability"

  testing_notes: "Story includes appropriate human-validation testing strategy for documentation deliverable (4 test cases defined). QA recommends executing Test Cases 1-3 with 2-3 security analysts before marking story as Done to validate guide comprehension, self-assessment tool, and debiasing technique application."
