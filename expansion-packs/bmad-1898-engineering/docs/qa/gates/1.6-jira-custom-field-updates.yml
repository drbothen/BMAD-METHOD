# Quality Gate Decision - Story 1.6
schema: 1
story: "1.6"
story_title: "JIRA Custom Field Updates"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Comprehensive implementation with excellent test coverage. Minor concerns around proactive rate limiting strategy and test automation framework planning."
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"

top_issues:
  - id: "PERF-1.6-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "No proactive rate limiting strategy - only reactive retry logic with exponential backoff"
    suggested_action: "Consider implementing request throttling or request queuing to prevent rate limit errors proactively"
  - id: "TEST-1.6-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "Test automation framework not yet defined (marked TBD in test file)"
    suggested_action: "Define test automation approach before Story 1.7 to enable automated regression testing"

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent security practices - no credential exposure, input validation, sanitized errors, no stack trace leakage"
  performance:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Reactive rate limiting only (exponential backoff after 429 errors). Consider proactive throttling for high-volume scenarios."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling for all MCP failure modes, graceful degradation with partial updates, retry logic for network failures"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent documentation, clear task structure, configuration externalized to YAML, self-documenting code"
