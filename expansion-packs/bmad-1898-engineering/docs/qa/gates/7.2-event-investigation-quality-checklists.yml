# Recommendations
recommendations:
  immediate: []
  future:
    - action: "Consider adding examples of borderline cases (60-74% range) to help reviewers calibrate quality thresholds"
      refs: ["README-event-investigation-scoring.md"]
    - action: "Track checklist usage metrics in Story 7.4 to identify items that are frequently unclear or require refinement"
      refs: ["All 7 checklists"]

# Detailed findings
findings:
  strengths:
    - "Exceptional documentation quality with comprehensive examples"
    - "Consistent format across all 7 checklists"
    - "Weighted scoring system properly implemented (100% distribution)"
    - "Thorough validation test confirms all compatibility checks pass"
    - "Event-specific failure patterns well-documented (6 patterns)"
    - "Automation bias detection is valuable addition for event investigations"
    - "README-event-investigation-scoring.md provides excellent overview"
    - "Clear quality classifications with actionable outcomes"
    - "Excellent examples of strong vs. weak investigations"
    - "Integration-ready for Stories 7.3 (template) and 7.4 (agent)"

  observations:
    - "Story file shows Epic 7 but Epic ID is 'TBD' in PRD (minor documentation gap, doesn't affect implementation quality)"
    - "VALIDATION-TEST.md demonstrates thorough quality verification approach"
    - "disposition-reasoning-checklist.md has particularly excellent examples"
    - "investigation-cognitive-bias-checklist.md provides comprehensive bias detection guidance"

# Acceptance criteria validation
acceptance_criteria:
  AC1_seven_checklists:
    status: PASS
    evidence: "All 7 checklists created: completeness (19 items), technical-accuracy (7 items), disposition-reasoning (7 items), contextualization (7 items), methodology (6 items), documentation-quality (6 items), cognitive-bias (6 items)"

  AC2_pass_fail_criteria:
    status: PASS
    evidence: "All checklists include Scoring section with (Passed / Total) × 100 formula and clear item descriptions"

  AC3_coverage_and_weights:
    status: PASS
    evidence: "7 dimensions with correct weights: Completeness 25%, Accuracy 20%, Disposition 20%, Context 15%, Methodology 10%, Documentation 5%, Bias 5% = 100%"

  AC4_weighted_scoring:
    status: PASS
    evidence: "Formula documented: Overall = Σ(Dimension Score × Weight), example calculation provided (89.05%), quality classifications defined"

  AC5_event_specific_issues:
    status: PASS
    evidence: "6 patterns documented: Missing Evidence, Weak Disposition Reasoning, Incomplete Correlation, Insufficient Contextualization, Shallow Methodology, Automation Bias"

  AC6_checklist_compatibility:
    status: PASS
    evidence: "VALIDATION-TEST.md confirms 10/10 validation checks passed, compatible with execute-checklist.md task in both interactive and YOLO modes"

    status: PASS
    evidence: "Automation bias added to investigation-cognitive-bias-checklist.md (item 5) with definition, detection criteria, and examples"

# Integration readiness
integration:
  story_7_3_template: "Ready - checklists provide dimension scores for template aggregation"
  story_7_4_agent: "Ready - all checklists compatible with execute-checklist.md task"
  execute_checklist_task: "Verified - VALIDATION-TEST.md confirms compatibility"
