    - action: 'Implement pytest-based executable test automation'
      refs: ['tests/workflows/test-security-analysis-review-workflow.md']
      priority: medium
      rationale: 'Current test suite is comprehensive documentation. Executable tests would enable CI/CD integration and automated regression testing.'
    - action: 'Clarify task dependency usage pattern'
      refs: ['tasks/review-security-enrichment.md', 'tasks/categorize-review-findings.md', 'tasks/fact-verify-claims.md']
      priority: low
      rationale: 'Referenced tasks exist but usage pattern unclear. Clarify if these are separate callable tasks or inline functionality.'
    - action: 'Implement automated state file cleanup'
      refs: ['tasks/review-security-enrichment.md']
      priority: low
      rationale: 'Add automated cleanup of workflow state files older than 30 days to prevent accumulation.'
