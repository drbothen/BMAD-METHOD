## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. TECH-001: Incorrect T-Number References or Mappings

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Category:** Technical
**Probability:** High (3) - ATT&CK framework has 200+ techniques across 14 tactics; complex domain knowledge makes incorrect references likely without rigorous verification
**Impact:** High (3) - Wrong T-numbers or mappings completely invalidate guide; analysts will make incorrect enrichment decisions, potentially missing attack indicators or creating false associations

**Affected Components:**

- All technique mappings (T1190, T1068, T1059, T1203, T1210, T1133, T1498)
- Mapping examples (RCE, SQL injection, privilege escalation, DoS, auth bypass)
- Quick reference table
- Detection implications per technique

**Detection Method:** Code review and comparison against authoritative MITRE ATT&CK source

**Mitigation Strategy:** Preventive

**Required Actions:**

1. **Verify every T-number against attack.mitre.org** - Confirm each technique exists and description matches
2. **Cross-reference mapping examples** - Validate CVE → Technique mappings using MITRE's own CVE-to-ATT&CK database
3. **Expert review** - Have experienced security analyst validate mappings against real-world scenarios
4. **Automated link validation** - Test all attack.mitre.org URLs return 200 OK
5. **Create mapping validation test** - Test 10 diverse CVEs per Epic 4 success criteria (must achieve 90%+ accuracy)

**Testing Requirements:**

- **Reference validation:** All T-numbers confirmed on attack.mitre.org
- **Mapping accuracy test:** 10 CVE sample achieves 90%+ expert agreement (Epic 4 acceptance criteria)
- **URL validation:** All external links return valid responses
- **Comprehension test:** New analyst can successfully map 3 sample CVEs using guide

**Residual Risk:** Low - After verification, some edge cases or ambiguous vulnerabilities may still have debatable mappings (ATT&CK allows multiple valid mappings for complex attacks)

**Owner:** QA (verification) → Dev (corrections if needed)
**Timeline:** Before story completion/deployment

---

## High Risks (Score 6)

### 2. TECH-002: Content Becomes Outdated as ATT&CK Framework Evolves

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Category:** Technical
**Probability:** High (3) - MITRE updates ATT&CK framework approximately 2x/year with new techniques, deprecations, and reorganizations
**Impact:** Medium (2) - Stale content reduces guide value and analyst confidence; however, old mappings remain mostly valid (techniques rarely deprecated)

**Affected Components:**

- T-number references
- Technique descriptions
- attack.mitre.org URLs
- Detection tool recommendations

**Mitigation Strategy:** Preventive + Detective

**Actions:**

1. **Document ATT&CK version** - Include "Based on ATT&CK v14 (Oct 2024)" in guide introduction
2. **Create maintenance schedule** - Review guide quarterly against ATT&CK release calendar
3. **Subscribe to MITRE updates** - Monitor attack-updates mailing list
4. **Version the guide** - Add changelog section to track updates
5. **Set review triggers** - Flag for review when ATT&CK major version released

**Testing Requirements:**

- Quarterly review checklist comparing guide to latest ATT&CK release
- URL validation tests in CI/CD pipeline

**Residual Risk:** Medium - Some lag between ATT&CK updates and guide updates is inevitable

**Owner:** Ops (maintenance scheduling) + Dev (content updates)
**Timeline:** Ongoing post-deployment

## Risk-Based Recommendations

### 1. Testing Priority (Immediate)

**Critical Path:**

1. Execute T-number verification (TECH-001) - **BLOCKING**
2. Execute 10-CVE mapping accuracy test (TECH-001) - **BLOCKING (Epic 4 criteria)**
3. SecOps review of detection guidance (SEC-001)
4. Usability testing with 2-3 analysts (BUS-002)
5. Integration testing with Story 1.5 workflow
6. URL validation test

**Test Environment Requirements:**

- Access to attack.mitre.org for reference verification
- 10 diverse CVEs for accuracy testing (spanning RCE, SQLi, privesc, DoS, auth bypass)
- Security analyst availability for expert validation and usability testing
- JIRA test environment for integration testing

### 2. Development Focus (Before Deployment)

**Code Review Emphasis:**

- Verify every T-number reference against attack.mitre.org
- Validate mapping examples against MITRE CVE database
- Review detection guidance for accuracy and actionability
- Ensure scope limitations clearly documented

**Additional Validation Needed:**

- Expert security analyst review of all mappings
- Comparison with MITRE's own CVE-to-ATT&CK mappings where available
- Cross-reference detection guidance with MITRE's detection recommendations

**Documentation to Add:**

- ATT&CK version number in introduction
- Scope limitations (vulnerability exploitation focus, not full APT campaigns)
- "How to use this guide" quick-start section
- Maintenance schedule and ownership

### 3. Deployment Strategy

**Phased Rollout:**

- **Phase 1 (Week 1):** Limited release to 2-3 experienced analysts for validation
- **Phase 2 (Week 2):** Full team access with training session
- **Phase 3 (Week 3+):** Standard use; gather feedback

**Rollback Procedure:**

- If critical errors discovered post-deployment, temporarily unpublish guide
- Notify analysts via Slack/email not to use guide until corrections made
- Fast-track corrections and re-verification

**Success Metrics:**

- 90%+ mapping accuracy maintained in production
- 80%+ analyst adoption within 4 weeks
- <5% broken external links

### 4. Monitoring Setup

**Metrics to Track:**
| Metric | Target | Frequency | Tool |

## Gate Recommendation

**Deterministic Mapping:**

- TECH-001 (score 9, critical) → Initial assessment: **FAIL**
- **However:** Mitigation plan is clear and executable
- **Recommendation:** **CONCERNS** (conditional PASS after verification)

**Rationale:**
This story contains 1 critical risk (TECH-001: incorrect T-numbers) that would result in FAIL gate. However:

1. Risk is well-understood and detection method is straightforward
2. Clear, actionable mitigation exists (verify against attack.mitre.org)
3. Testing requirements are specific and achievable
4. Epic 4 already includes 90% accuracy success criteria

**Conditions for PASS:**

1. ✅ All T-numbers verified against attack.mitre.org (addresses TECH-001)
2. ✅ 10-CVE mapping accuracy test achieves ≥90% (Epic 4 criteria)
3. ✅ Detection guidance reviewed by SecOps (addresses SEC-001)
4. ✅ Maintenance schedule created (addresses OPS-001)
5. ✅ Usability testing completed with 2+ analysts (addresses BUS-002)

**Unmitigated Risks:**

- TECH-002, DATA-001: Acceptable with monitoring plan
- All other risks: Low impact or low probability; standard monitoring sufficient
