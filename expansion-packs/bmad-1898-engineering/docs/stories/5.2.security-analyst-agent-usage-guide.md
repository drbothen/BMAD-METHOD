### Best Practices for Security Analysts

**1. Pre-Enrichment Preparation:**
- Review JIRA ticket for completeness before enrichment
- Verify CVE ID is correct and in standard format
- Ensure asset criticality and exposure are documented
- Gather any additional context from detection tools

**2. Effective CVE Research:**
- Trust Perplexity AI but verify critical facts against authoritative sources
- For critical vulnerabilities, manually verify CISA KEV and vendor advisories
- Check for multiple related CVEs (vulnerability chains)
- Note publication dates and timeline (0-day vs. known vuln)

**3. Business Context Assessment:**
- Collaborate with asset owners to confirm criticality ratings
- Understand system dependencies and business processes
- Document impact accurately (don't exaggerate or minimize)
- Consider regulatory requirements (PCI-DSS, HIPAA, etc.)

**4. Remediation Guidance Quality:**
- Always provide primary remediation (patch version)
- Include workarounds for systems that can't patch immediately
- Suggest compensating controls for defense-in-depth
- Make guidance actionable with specific commands/steps
- Include verification steps to confirm remediation success

**5. Time Management:**
- Use full enrichment (*enrich-ticket) for comprehensive analysis
- Use standalone commands (*research-cve, *assess-priority) for quick tasks
- Monitor stage progress and investigate if any stage exceeds 2x expected time
- If research stalls, use manual fallback and document sources

**6. Quality Self-Review:**
- Before posting to JIRA, review enrichment for completeness
- Verify all 12 template sections are populated
- Check that sources are authoritative (NIST, CISA, vendor advisories)
- Ensure priority rationale explains all factors considered
- Confirm remediation steps are clear and implementable

**7. Collaboration with Reviewers:**
- For P1/P2 priorities, expect quality review (100% reviewed)
- For P3/P4/P5, some enrichments may be sampled for review
- Respond constructively to review feedback (blameless culture)
- Treat reviews as learning opportunities
- Document lessons learned for future enrichments

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Issue 1: CVE ID Not Found in Ticket**
- **Symptom:** Stage 1 error: "CVE ID not found in ticket summary or description"
- **Cause:** JIRA ticket missing CVE identifier
- **Solution:**
  1. Agent will prompt: "Please enter CVE ID or vulnerability description:"
  2. Provide CVE ID manually: `CVE-2024-1234`
  3. OR provide description: "Apache Struts remote code execution"
  4. Workflow resumes from Stage 2

**Issue 2: Perplexity Research Timeout**
- **Symptom:** Stage 2 stalls or times out after 5+ minutes
- **Cause:** Perplexity API timeout, network issue, or rate limiting
- **Solution (Automatic):**
  1. Agent retries with simplified query
  2. Falls back to `search` instead of `deep_research`
  3. If retry fails, prompts for manual research
- **Solution (Manual):**
  1. Research CVE manually at nvd.nist.gov, cisa.gov/kev
  2. Enter findings when prompted
  3. Workflow continues with manual data

**Issue 3: CVSS/EPSS/KEV Data Not Available**
- **Symptom:** Research returns incomplete metrics
- **Cause:** CVE is very new (< 24 hours old), or CVE doesn't exist in NVD
- **Solution:**
  1. Check CVSS in vendor advisory (if published)
  2. Estimate EPSS as "N/A (new CVE)" - will update after 48 hours
  3. Check KEV manually at cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog
  4. Document as "Preliminary analysis - awaiting NVD publication"
  5. Re-run enrichment after 48 hours

**Issue 4: JIRA Update Fails**
- **Symptom:** Stage 8 error: "Failed to update JIRA ticket"
- **Possible Causes:**
  1. Permissions: User lacks edit permission on ticket
  2. Field errors: Custom field ID incorrect in config.yaml
  3. Network: Connection to JIRA Cloud lost
  4. Validation: Field value doesn't match field type/constraints
- **Solution:**
  1. Agent saves enrichment locally: `enrichments/{ticket-id}-enrichment.md`
  2. Verify permissions: Can you edit the ticket manually?
  3. Verify custom field IDs in config.yaml match JIRA
  4. Manually copy enrichment comment to JIRA if needed
  5. Update custom fields manually as fallback

**Issue 5: Business Context Unknown**
- **Symptom:** Agent prompts for Asset Criticality Rating or System Exposure
- **Cause:** Custom fields not populated in JIRA ticket
- **Solution:**
  1. Consult asset inventory or CMDB for criticality rating
  2. Consult network diagrams for exposure classification
  3. If unknown, use conservative defaults:
     - ACR: Default to "Medium" (escalate if needed)
     - Exposure: Default to "Internal" (safer assumption)
  4. Document assumption in Analyst Notes section
  5. Follow up with asset owner to confirm

**Issue 6: Enrichment Takes > 15 Minutes**
- **Symptom:** Workflow exceeds 15-minute target
- **Common Causes:**
  1. Stage 2 (Research): Complex CVE or Perplexity slow response
  2. Stage 4 (Remediation): No clear patch available, requires extensive research
  3. Stage 5 (ATT&CK): Unfamiliar vulnerability type
- **Solutions:**
  1. Monitor stage progress - identify which stage is slow
  2. For slow research: Use simpler Perplexity query or manual research
  3. For remediation: Focus on vendor advisory, skip non-essential workarounds
  4. For ATT&CK: Use general mapping if specific technique unclear
  5. Time management: Prioritize completeness for P1/P2, efficiency for P3/P4/P5

**Issue 7: Template Validation Fails**
- **Symptom:** Stage 7 error: "Template validation failed - missing sections"
- **Cause:** One or more of 12 template sections not populated
- **Solution:**
  1. Review enrichment data for gaps
  2. Most common missing sections:
     - Related CVEs (use "None identified" if none found)
     - Verification & Testing (add basic "Re-scan system after patch" if unknown)
     - Threat Intelligence (use "No active threat intelligence" if none)
  3. Populate placeholder text for optional sections
  4. Re-run Stage 7 documentation generation
