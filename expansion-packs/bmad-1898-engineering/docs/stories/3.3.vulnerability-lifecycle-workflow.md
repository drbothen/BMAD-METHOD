## Dev Notes

### Epic and Source References

**Parent Epic:** Epic 3: Workflow Integration and Orchestration
**Epic File:** `expansion-packs/bmad-1898-engineering/docs/prd/epic-3-workflow-integration.md`

**Architecture References:**
- JIRA workflow standards: `docs/architecture/jira-workflow-standards.md` (defines all 7 statuses, transitions, custom fields, SLAs)
- Source tree: `docs/architecture/source-tree.md` (defines file locations and directory structure)

**Related Stories:**
- Story 3.1: Security Alert Enrichment Workflow (Stage 2: Enrichment)
- Story 3.2: Security Analysis Review Workflow (Stage 3: Review)
- Story 3.4: Priority-Based Review Triggering (Review decision logic between Stage 2 and Stage 3)

**Source Verification:**
- Workflow design based on Epic 3 requirements (lines 111-123 in epic-3-workflow-integration.md)
- 7 lifecycle stages specified in Epic 3 Acceptance Criteria #1
- JIRA status names defined in `docs/architecture/jira-workflow-standards.md` (lines 10-18)
- Metrics requirements from Epic 3 Success Criteria (lines 177-179)
- Audit trail requirements from Epic 3 AC #4 and architecture document (lines 219-227)

### JIRA Configuration Requirements

**IMPORTANT:** This workflow requires specific JIRA configuration. Refer to `docs/architecture/jira-workflow-standards.md` for complete setup.

**Required JIRA Statuses** (must exist in JIRA project):
1. Open
2. In Progress
3. In Review
4. Remediation Planning
5. Remediation In Progress
6. Verification
7. Closed

**Required Status Transitions** (must be configured in JIRA):
- Open → In Progress (Analyst starts enrichment)
- In Progress → In Review (P1/P2 or sampled P3/P4/P5)
- In Progress → Remediation Planning (P3/P4/P5, review skipped)
- In Review → In Progress (Critical Issues found)
- In Review → Remediation Planning (Review approved)
- Remediation Planning → Remediation In Progress
- Remediation In Progress → Verification
- Verification → Remediation In Progress (Verification failed)
- Verification → Closed (Verification passed)

**Validation:** Before implementing this story, validate that all statuses and transitions exist in target JIRA instance.

### Integration Points with Technical Details

**JIRA Cloud (Atlassian MCP):**
- API: JIRA REST API v3
- Authentication: OAuth 2.0 via Atlassian MCP server
- Tools used:
  - `mcp__atlassian__getJiraIssue` - Read ticket data
  - `mcp__atlassian__addCommentToJiraIssue` - Post lifecycle comments
  - `mcp__atlassian__updateJiraIssue` - Update custom fields
  - `mcp__atlassian__transitionJiraIssue` - Change status
- Custom fields: CVSS, EPSS, KEV, Priority, Quality Score (field IDs in config.yaml)
- Error handling: Retry on transient failures, fail gracefully with user notification

**Vulnerability Scanners (Detection):**
- Supported scanners: Qualys, Rapid7, Tenable (any that can create JIRA tickets)
- Integration: Scanner creates JIRA ticket with CVE ID in summary/description
- Data format: CVE ID must be extractable via regex pattern
- Fallback: Manual ticket creation supported

**Patch Management Tools (Remediation Execution):**
- Examples: Ansible Tower, SCCM, custom deployment scripts
- Integration: Manual - DevOps team uses remediation guidance from enrichment
- Future enhancement: API integration for automated deployment tracking

**Metrics Dashboards (Reporting):**
- Data export: CSV format from `metrics/enrichment-metrics.csv`
- Visualization: Grafana, Tableau, Power BI, or custom dashboards
- Key metrics: MTTR, quality scores, stage durations, SLA compliance
- Update frequency: Real-time (metrics logged immediately after each stage)

### Testing

**Test Location:** `expansion-packs/bmad-1898-engineering/tests/workflows/`

**Test Standards:**

- End-to-end integration test through complete lifecycle
- Test all stage transitions
- Verify metrics captured at each stage
- Test audit trail completeness

**Test Cases:**

1. P1 ticket: Detection → Enrichment → Mandatory Review → Remediation → Verification → Closure
2. P4 ticket: Detection → Enrichment → Optional Review (skip) → Remediation → Closure
3. Failed review: Enrichment → Review → Back to Enrichment (revision loop)
4. Failed verification: Remediation → Verification (fail) → Remediation (retry) → Verification (pass) → Closure
5. JIRA configuration validation: Verify all statuses and transitions exist before workflow execution
6. Metrics capture: Verify all metrics logged to CSV at each stage
7. Directory creation: Verify required directories created if missing
8. Audit trail: Verify complete audit trail from detection to closure
