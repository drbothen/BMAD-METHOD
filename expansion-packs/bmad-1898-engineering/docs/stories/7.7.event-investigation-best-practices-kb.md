### Disposition Framework Examples

**Source:** Epic 7 FR-2.3 (Disposition Reasoning Checklist) requires 5+ examples per disposition type.

**True Positive Examples:**

1. External IP scanning multiple ports → Confirmed reconnaissance activity
2. Unauthorized SSH connection from unknown source → Confirmed lateral movement attempt
3. Data exfiltration to known C2 domain → Confirmed data theft
4. Malware hash detected on endpoint → Confirmed malware infection
5. Privilege escalation attempt on critical server → Confirmed unauthorized access attempt

**False Positive Examples:**

1. Vulnerability scanner triggering IDS signatures → Authorized security testing
2. Large file transfer flagged as exfiltration → Legitimate backup operation
3. Failed logins during password change → User credential update
4. Port scan from internal IP → Network discovery by IT operations
5. SSH from unexpected location → VPN endpoint change

**Benign True Positive Examples:**

1. SSH connection in control environment → Authorized maintenance by vendor (per Epic Appendix A example)
2. ICS protocol anomaly → Firmware update in progress
3. Multiple failed logins → User forgot password (not brute force)
4. Unusual network traffic → Batch job processing
5. File modification on critical system → Authorized patch application

### Common False Positive Patterns

**Note:** The tuning recommendations below are illustrative examples based on common industry practices. When creating the KB, developer should validate these against authoritative sources (SANS, vendor documentation) or clearly mark them as examples requiring environment-specific customization.

**Source:** Epic 7 FR-2.5 requires common FP patterns for ICS/IDS/SIEM alerts with tuning recommendations.

**ICS/SCADA False Positives:**

- **Pattern:** "SSH Connection in Control Environments" (per Epic Appendix A)
  - **Cause:** Scheduled maintenance, firmware updates, vendor support
  - **Tuning:** Whitelist authorized source IPs, exclude maintenance windows (00:00-04:00 UTC)

- **Pattern:** "Modbus Write Command to PLC"
  - **Cause:** HMI operator commands, SCADA system updates
  - **Tuning:** Whitelist HMI IP ranges, exclude expected write operations

- **Pattern:** "Unusual Protocol Traffic"
  - **Cause:** Legacy equipment using non-standard protocols
  - **Tuning:** Baseline normal protocol usage, exclude known legacy devices

**IDS/IPS False Positives:**

- **Pattern:** "Port Scan Detected"
  - **Cause:** Vulnerability scanners (Nessus, Qualys), network discovery tools
  - **Tuning:** Whitelist scanner IPs, schedule scans during maintenance windows

- **Pattern:** "SQL Injection Attempt"
  - **Cause:** Application error messages containing SQL keywords
  - **Tuning:** Refine signature to exclude benign SQL keywords in error messages

- **Pattern:** "Large Data Transfer"
  - **Cause:** Database backups, file synchronization
  - **Tuning:** Whitelist backup server IPs, exclude scheduled backup windows

**SIEM False Positives:**

- **Pattern:** "Multiple Failed Logins"
  - **Cause:** Password changes, expired credentials, VPN reconnections
  - **Tuning:** Increase threshold, exclude VPN endpoints, add time-window constraints

- **Pattern:** "Anomalous User Behavior"
  - **Cause:** Batch jobs, service accounts, new employee onboarding
  - **Tuning:** Exclude service accounts, adjust anomaly baseline

- **Pattern:** "Privilege Escalation Detected"
  - **Cause:** Authorized sudo usage by sysadmins
  - **Tuning:** Whitelist sysadmin accounts, exclude expected elevation patterns
