### Quick Reference Card Content

**Analyst Quick Reference (1 page):**

```
EVENT INVESTIGATION QUICK REFERENCE

Command: *investigate-event {ticket-id}

Investigation Steps:
1. ☐ Collect alert metadata (source, rule ID, severity, timestamp)
2. ☐ Document network identifiers (IPs, hostnames, protocols, ports)
3. ☐ Collect evidence (logs, correlation, historical context)
4. ☐ Assess asset context (criticality, function, business impact)
5. ☐ Perform technical analysis (protocol validation, attack vectors)
6. ☐ Determine disposition (TP/FP/BTP) with confidence level
7. ☐ Document investigation and update JIRA

Disposition Decision Tree:
- Is activity malicious? → YES: True Positive
- Is activity real but authorized? → YES: Benign True Positive
- Is alert incorrect (no activity)? → YES: False Positive

Common Pitfalls:
- Automation bias: Don't blindly trust alert severity
- Missing evidence: Always collect logs before determining disposition
- Weak reasoning: Support disposition with specific evidence
```

**Reviewer Quick Reference (1 page):**

```
EVENT INVESTIGATION REVIEW QUICK REFERENCE

Command: *review-enrichment {ticket-id} --type=event

7 Quality Dimensions:
1. Investigation Completeness (25%): All steps performed?
2. Technical Accuracy (20%): Facts correct?
3. Disposition Reasoning (20%): Evidence supports disposition?
4. Contextualization (15%): Business impact assessed?
5. Investigation Methodology (10%): Rigorous process?
6. Documentation Quality (5%): Clear and professional?
7. Cognitive Bias (5%): Objective analysis?

Quality Classifications:
- Excellent: 90-100% - Minor or no gaps
- Good: 75-89% - Solid with some improvements
- Needs Improvement: 60-74% - Significant gaps
- Inadequate: <60% - Major deficiencies

Blameless Feedback:
✓ Acknowledge strengths first
✓ Use "Consider adding..." not "You missed..."
✓ Provide specific, actionable recommendations
✓ Link to learning resources
✗ Avoid blame language
