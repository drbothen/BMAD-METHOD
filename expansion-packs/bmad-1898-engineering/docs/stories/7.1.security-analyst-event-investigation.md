# Story 7.1: Security Analyst Event Investigation Capability

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** Security Analyst agent,
**I want** to investigate security event alerts (ICS, IDS, SIEM) with structured enrichment,
**so that** I can provide comprehensive analysis of alert disposition, investigation methodology, and incident triage.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Agent accepts event investigation command with ticket-id parameter
2. Agent detects event alert type (ICS, IDS, SIEM) from ticket metadata
3. Agent performs systematic investigation collecting alert metadata, network identifiers, timeline, evidence

5. Agent generates structured event investigation document from template
6. Agent updates JIRA ticket with investigation findings
7. Agent handles errors gracefully with clear guidance for incomplete investigations

### Investigation Methodology Research

Based on comprehensive research of security event investigation best practices, the following principles guide this story's implementation:

**NIST SP 800-61 Framework Integration:**

- Detection & Analysis phase activities (data collection, correlation, prioritization)
- Evidence preservation and chain of custody protocols
- Systematic investigation workflow with clear decision points

**Key Investigation Steps (Industry Best Practices):**

1. Alert Metadata Capture (source, timestamp, severity, rule ID)
2. Network/Host Identifier Documentation (IPs, hostnames, asset types)
3. Timeline Reconstruction (detection time, occurrence time, investigation time)
4. Log Collection and Evidence Preservation
5. Event Correlation (related events, historical patterns)
6. Asset Context Assessment (criticality, function, ownership)
7. Technical Analysis (protocol validation, log interpretation, attack vectors)
8. Hypothesis-Driven Investigation (alternative explanations, confidence levels)

**Disposition Framework:**

- **True Positive (TP):** Malicious activity confirmed with evidence
- **False Positive (FP):** Benign activity incorrectly flagged, no threat
- **Benign True Positive (BTP):** Real activity detected but authorized (maintenance, testing)

**Cognitive Bias Awareness:**

- Confirmation bias (seeking only supporting evidence)
- Anchoring bias (over-reliance on initial alert severity)
- Automation bias (blindly trusting alert systems)
- Availability bias (over-weighting recent/memorable incidents)

### Event Alert Type Detection Heuristics

The task must auto-detect event alert types from ticket metadata and content structure:

**ICS/SCADA Platform Alerts:**

- Platforms: Claroty, Nozomi Networks, Dragos, CyberX
- Indicators: "ICS", "SCADA", "OT", "Operational Technology", "PLC", "HMI", "Modbus", "DNP3"
- Typical metadata: Asset type (PLC, HMI, RTU), Zone (Control, DMZ), Criticality levels
- Example: "Claroty Alert: SSH Connection in Control Environments (#317)"

**IDS/IPS Alerts:**

- Platforms: Snort, Suricata, Palo Alto Threat Prevention, Cisco Firepower
- Indicators: "IDS", "IPS", "Intrusion Detection", "Threat Signature", "SID:"
- Typical metadata: Signature ID, Classification (attempted-admin, trojan-activity), Priority
- Example: "Snort Alert [1:12345:6]: ET EXPLOIT Known Malicious Traffic"

**SIEM Correlation Alerts:**

- Platforms: Splunk, IBM QRadar, Microsoft Sentinel, Elastic Security
- Indicators: "SIEM", "Correlation Rule", "Use Case", "Notable Event", "Incident"
- Typical metadata: Correlation rule ID, Risk score, Aggregated events count
- Example: "Splunk Notable: Multiple Failed Logins Followed by Success (UC-AUTH-001)"

**Detection Logic:**

```
1. Check JIRA Issue Type field:
   - "Event Alert" → Event investigation workflow
   - "ICS Alert" → ICS-specific investigation
   - "Security Vulnerability" → CVE enrichment workflow (existing)

2. Check ticket description/summary keywords:
   - Contains ICS/SCADA terms → ICS alert
   - Contains IDS/IPS terms → IDS alert
   - Contains SIEM terms → SIEM alert
   - Contains "CVE-YYYY-NNNNN" → CVE enrichment (existing)

3. Check comment structure:
   - Contains "Alert Name/Signature" section → Event investigation
   - Contains "Security Analysis Enrichment" heading → CVE enrichment (existing)

4. If ambiguous:
   - Prompt user to specify investigation type
   - Provide context clues from ticket to aid selection
```

### Example Execution Flow

**Scenario:** Security Analyst investigating AOD-4052 (Claroty ICS Alert - SSH Connection in Control Environments)

1. **User Action:** Security Analyst agent receives command `*investigate-event AOD-4052`
2. **Task Invocation:** Agent loads and executes `investigate-event-alert.md` task with ticket-id parameter
3. **Ticket Reading:** Task calls `read-jira-ticket.md` to fetch ticket data
4. **Alert Type Detection:** Task identifies "Event Alert" Issue Type and Claroty platform from description → ICS alert
5. **Metadata Collection:** Task extracts alert name, severity, sensor, rule ID, category, timestamp
6. **Network Identifiers:** Task extracts source/dest IPs, hostnames, asset types, zone, protocols
7. **Evidence Collection:** Task prompts analyst to provide relevant logs, historical context, asset information
8. **Technical Analysis:** Task guides analysis of SSH traffic patterns, port 22 usage, source/dest legitimacy
9. **Disposition Determination:** Task evaluates evidence, considers alternatives, determines disposition
10. **Document Generation:** Task calls `create-doc.md` with `event-investigation-tmpl.yaml` template
11. **JIRA Update:** Task posts investigation findings as comment, updates custom fields
12. **Completion:** Task returns success with investigation summary

**Expected Output:**

- Structured investigation document (markdown format)
- JIRA ticket updated with investigation comment
- Custom fields updated (Disposition, Confidence Level, Next Actions)
- Investigation metrics captured (duration, evidence sources, disposition)

### MCP Integration Context

**Atlassian JIRA MCP Server** - Read and update JIRA tickets

**Status:** Required (same as existing CVE enrichment workflow)

**Available Tools:**

- `mcp__atlassian__getJiraIssue` - Fetch ticket data
- `mcp__atlassian__updateJiraIssue` - Update ticket fields
- `mcp__atlassian__addComment` - Post investigation findings

**Perplexity MCP Server** - AI-powered research for threat intelligence (optional)

**Status:** Optional (for threat intelligence correlation)

**Available Tools:**

- `mcp__perplexity__search` - Quick lookup of threat intelligence for IPs, domains
- `mcp__perplexity__reason` - Analysis of attack patterns and techniques

**Tool Usage:**

- IP reputation lookup: "Is IP 192.0.2.50 associated with known malicious activity or threat actors?"
- Protocol analysis: "Is SSH traffic from 10.50.1.100 to 10.10.5.25 port 22 typical for ICS environments?"
- Alert pattern research: "Known false positive patterns for Claroty SSH Connection in Control Environments alert"

### Error Handling

**Missing Ticket Data:**

- Prompt user for required information (alert name, severity, network identifiers)
- Flag gaps: "⚠️ Source IP not available in ticket - manual collection required"
- Continue with available data, document limitations

**Unsupported Alert Type:**

- Detect unsupported platforms or alert formats
- Provide guidance: "This alert type is not fully supported. Manual investigation recommended."
- Offer generic investigation template as fallback

**Incomplete Evidence:**

- Flag evidence gaps: "⚠️ No logs collected - investigation incomplete"
- Require minimum evidence for disposition determination
- Document what evidence was attempted but unavailable

**JIRA Connection Failures:**

- Save investigation document locally
- Retry JIRA update with exponential backoff (max 3 attempts)
- Provide manual posting instructions if all retries fail

**Disposition Uncertainty:**

- Require confidence level assignment (High/Medium/Low)
- If confidence is Low, recommend escalation or peer review
- Document alternative dispositions considered

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-11-09

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Risk Assessment

**Risk Factors Identified:**

- Security domain content (event investigation workflow)
- Large implementation (2000+ lines across 4 files)
- 7 acceptance criteria
- **Review Depth:** Deep review warranted

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Quality: GOOD with CONCERNS**

The implementation demonstrates strong adherence to BMAD framework patterns with comprehensive documentation and systematic workflow design. The 7-stage investigation workflow follows NIST SP 800-61 best practices and integrates well with existing Security Analyst agent capabilities.

**Strengths:**

- Excellent requirements traceability with all 7 ACs clearly mapped to test coverage
- Comprehensive test suite (27 test cases covering all workflows and error scenarios)
- Systematic investigation methodology with clear stage delineation
- Thoughtful error handling with graceful degradation patterns
- Good separation of concerns (task/template/agent/tests)
- Consistent naming conventions and BMAD pattern adherence
- Clear documentation with duration estimates and elicitation formats

**Areas of Concern:**

1. **PII Handling:** No explicit guidance for handling PII in evidence collection (Stage 4)
2. **Performance:** No timeout configuration for Perplexity MCP queries (could hang)
3. **Maintainability:** Task file is very long (733 lines) - future refactoring recommended
4. **Configuration:** JIRA custom field names should be config-referenced, not hardcoded
5. **Test Data:** Test ticket IDs are placeholders - need actual test tickets created
6. **Documentation:** Missing explicit chain of custody guidance for evidence preservation

### Requirements Traceability

**Mapping Quality: EXCELLENT ✓**

### Security Review

**Status: CONCERNS** ⚠️

**Findings:**

1. **PII in Evidence Logs (MEDIUM):** Stage 4 collects log excerpts that may contain PII (usernames, email addresses, IP addresses) without explicit handling guidance
   - **Recommendation:** Add PII redaction guidance or warning in elicitation prompt
   - **Reference:** investigate-event-alert.md:217-288 (Stage 4 Evidence Collection)

2. **Credential Exposure Prevention (PASS):** TC-025 validates no credentials exposed in error messages ✓

3. **Audit Trail (PASS):** Local file save prioritized before JIRA update ensures evidence preservation ✓

4. **Chain of Custody (MEDIUM):** No explicit guidance on evidence preservation protocols
   - **Recommendation:** Add chain of custody documentation to investigation methodology section
   - **Reference:** investigate-event-alert.md template integration

### Performance Considerations

**Status: CONCERNS** ⚠️

**Findings:**

1. **Perplexity Query Timeout (MEDIUM):** No timeout specified for Perplexity MCP queries in Stage 5
   - **Impact:** Investigation could hang indefinitely on network issues or API delays
   - **Recommendation:** Add 30-second timeout with fallback to manual analysis
   - **Reference:** investigate-event-alert.md:316-320 (Threat Intelligence Correlation)

2. **Target Duration (PASS):** 15-25 minute target documented ✓

3. **Retry Logic (PASS):** JIRA retry with exponential backoff implemented ✓

### Maintainability Assessment

**Status: CONCERNS** ⚠️

**Findings:**

1. **Task File Length (MEDIUM):** investigate-event-alert.md is 733 lines - approaching complexity threshold
   - **Impact:** Difficult to navigate, higher cognitive load for maintenance
   - **Recommendation:** Consider subtask decomposition in future iterations
   - **Not Blocking:** Current implementation is well-documented and structured

2. **Configuration Hardcoding (MEDIUM):** JIRA custom field names hardcoded in multiple locations
   - **Impact:** Requires file edits to support different JIRA schemas
   - **Recommendation:** Move field mappings to .bmad-1898-engineering/config.yaml
   - **References:** investigate-event-alert.md:536-541

3. **Test Data Management (MEDIUM):** Test ticket IDs are placeholders
   - **Impact:** Tests cannot be executed without manual ticket creation
   - **Recommendation:** Create test tickets and update test file before production deployment
   - **Reference:** test-investigate-event-alert.md:20-27

### Files Modified During Review

**No files modified during this review.**

All identified issues are documentation/configuration improvements that should be addressed by the development team rather than QA modifications.

### Gate Status

**Gate: CONCERNS** → docs/qa/gates/7.1-security-analyst-event-investigation.yml

**Quality Score:** 70/100

**Rationale:** Implementation is functionally complete with excellent test coverage and solid architecture. However, three NFR areas have medium-severity concerns (Security, Performance, Maintainability) that should be addressed before production deployment. No blocking issues identified - all concerns can be resolved with documentation updates and configuration additions.

**Risk Profile:** docs/qa/assessments/7.1-risk-20251109.md (not generated - no high-risk factors)

**NFR Assessment:** Inline above (Security: CONCERNS, Performance: CONCERNS, Reliability: PASS, Maintainability: CONCERNS)

### Recommended Status

**✗ Changes Required** - Address 3 immediate action items before marking "Done":

1. Add PII handling guidance
2. Add Perplexity timeout configuration
3. Create test tickets and update test file

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours to address immediate concerns

**Note:** Story owner decides final status. The implementation is solid and production-ready after addressing the immediate improvements listed above.
