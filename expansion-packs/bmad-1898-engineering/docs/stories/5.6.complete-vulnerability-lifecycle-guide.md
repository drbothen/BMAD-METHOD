- **Handoff Procedures:**
  - **DevOps → Security (verification request):**
    - DevOps completes remediation
    - JIRA transitioned to "Verification"
    - Assigned to Security Analyst for verification scan
    - Analyst expected to scan within 24 hours (P1/P2) or 48 hours (P3-P5)
  - **Security → DevOps (if verification failed):**
    - Scan results posted to JIRA
    - Root cause documented
    - JIRA re-assigned to DevOps
    - DevOps investigates and re-remediates
- **Common Issues:**
  - Scan false negative (vulnerability fixed but scanner outdated) → Manual verification, update scanner
  - Scan false positive (still flagged but actually patched) → Verify patch version manually, close with exception
  - Partial remediation (some systems patched, others not) → Identify gap, complete remediation

**Workflow Diagram:**

```
Open → In Progress (analyst starts enrichment)
  ↓
In Progress → In Review (if P1/P2 or sampled P3-P5)
In Progress → Remediation Planning (if P3-P5 not sampled)
  ↓
In Review → In Progress (if critical gaps found - re-enrichment)
In Review → Remediation Planning (if approved)
  ↓
Remediation Planning → Remediation In Progress (plan approved)

### Role Responsibility Matrix (RACI)

> **Note:** This RACI matrix is **proposed documentation** based on workflow analysis and role responsibilities derived from the lifecycle stages. Organizations should adapt this matrix to their specific team structure and operational model.

| Stage                    | Security Analyst   | Security Reviewer | DevOps/SysAdmin | Security Manager |
| ------------------------ | ------------------ | ----------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |

- C: Consulted (input requested)
- I: Informed (kept updated)

---

### SLA Tracking and Escalation

> **Note:** SLA definitions below are sourced from Story 1.7 (authoritative source). Escalation procedures and thresholds are **proposed operational guidelines** based on industry best practices. Organizations should adjust escalation thresholds based on their operational capabilities and risk tolerance.

**SLA Definitions (Source: Story 1.7):**

- **P1 (Critical):** 24 hours from detection to closure
- **P2 (High):** 7 days from detection to closure
- **P3 (Medium):** 30 days from detection to closure
- **P4 (Low):** 90 days from detection to closure
- **P5 (Trivial):** Best effort (no SLA)

**SLA Start Time:** Detection timestamp (JIRA ticket created date)
**SLA End Time:** Closure timestamp (JIRA ticket closed date) OR Verification passed timestamp

**SLA Pause Conditions (Clock Stops):**

- Waiting on vendor response (patch not available)
- Maintenance window constraints (change freeze, blackout period)
- Risk acceptance process (awaiting executive approval)
- External dependencies (third-party remediation)
- **Documentation Required:** JIRA comment documenting pause reason and expected resume date

**SLA Resume:** When blocker removed, document in JIRA, clock resumes

**SLA Escalation Procedures:**

**P1 Critical - Escalation at 18 hours (75% of SLA):**

- Automatic notification to Security Manager
- Escalation meeting scheduled
- Status update required every 4 hours
- Executive notification at 24 hours if not closed

**P2 High - Escalation at 5 days (71% of SLA):**

- Automatic notification to Security Manager
- Daily status update required
- DevOps manager looped in if remediation blocked

**P3 Medium - Escalation at 25 days (83% of SLA):**

- Notification to Security Manager
- Weekly status update required

**P4/P5 - Monitoring only (no escalation):**

- Quarterly review of open P4/P5 tickets
- Batch closure or upgrade if needed

**SLA Breach Handling:**

- Incident report required for P1/P2 SLA breaches
- Root cause analysis (why breach occurred)
- Process improvement recommendations
- Executive summary for P1 breaches

**SLA Reporting Dashboards:**

- Current SLA status (red/yellow/green by ticket)
- SLA compliance rate (% met vs. total)
- Average time per stage (identify bottlenecks)
- Aging report (tickets open > SLA deadline)

1. **Priority: Recommended**
   - **Action:** Create test cases per AC7 specification
   - **Refs:** Story lines 1046-1076
   - **Rationale:** Story defines 5 test cases (TC-DOC-060 through TC-DOC-064) - implementation would validate documentation accuracy

2. **Priority: Enhancement**
   - **Action:** Consider adding JIRA workflow XML configuration export
   - **Refs:** `vulnerability-lifecycle-guide.md:720-761`
   - **Rationale:** Would enable teams to import workflow directly into JIRA

3. **Priority: Nice-to-Have**
   - **Action:** Consider adding Mermaid diagram for handoff flows
   - **Refs:** `vulnerability-lifecycle-guide.md:844-976`
   - **Rationale:** Visual representation would complement text handoff procedures

4. **Priority: Nice-to-Have**
   - **Action:** Consider adding example SLA dashboard screenshots
   - **Refs:** `vulnerability-lifecycle-guide.md:1072-1096`
