# BMAD-1898 Priority Framework

## Introduction

The BMAD-1898 Priority Framework uses **multi-factor risk assessment** to prioritize vulnerabilities based on genuine exploitable threat, not severity alone. This approach reduces alert fatigue by focusing remediation efforts on vulnerabilities that pose real risk.

**Core Principle:** CVSS + EPSS + KEV + Business Context = Accurate Priority

---

## Priority Levels (P1-P5)

### P1 - Critical (24 Hour SLA)

**Definition:** Immediate action required. Critical vulnerabilities with high exploitability affecting critical systems. War room may be needed.

**Criteria (ANY of the following):**
1. **CVSS ≥9.0 + EPSS ≥0.75 + KEV Listed**
   - Critical severity + very high exploitation probability + active exploitation confirmed

2. **Active Exploitation + Internet-Facing + Critical ACR**
   - Any CVSS with confirmed exploitation in wild + public exposure + mission-critical system

3. **KEV Listed + Internet-Facing + Critical ACR**
   - CISA-confirmed exploitation + public exposure + mission-critical system

**Examples:**

**Example 1: Apache Struts 2 RCE**
- CVE-2024-1234
- CVSS: 9.8 (Critical)
- EPSS: 0.85 (97th percentile - very high exploitation probability)
- KEV: Listed (2024-11-01)
- System: Internet-facing production web server
- ACR: Critical
- **Priority: P1** (All factors indicate immediate high risk)

**Example 2: Zero-Day RCE with Active Exploitation**
- CVE-2024-5678
- CVSS: 8.5 (High)
- EPSS: 0.95 (99th percentile)
- KEV: Listed
- System: Internet-facing API gateway
- ACR: Critical
- Active exploitation: Confirmed in threat intelligence
- **Priority: P1** (Active exploitation + critical system)

**SLA Timeline:** 24 hours from enrichment completion

**Actions Required:**
- Immediate notification to security leadership
- Emergency change approval (bypass standard CAB)
- Deploy patch or workaround within 24 hours
- If patch unavailable: Implement compensating controls or take system offline
- Post-incident review after remediation

**Review Requirement:** Mandatory peer review

---

### P2 - High (7 Day SLA)

**Definition:** Urgent action required. High severity vulnerabilities with significant exploitability or important systems affected.

**Criteria (ANY of the following):**
1. **CVSS ≥7.0 + EPSS ≥0.50 + (KEV Listed OR Public Exploit)**
   - High severity + high exploitation probability + exploit available

2. **CVSS ≥9.0 + High ACR + Internet-Facing**
   - Critical CVSS + important system + public exposure (even without active exploitation)

3. **KEV Listed + Internal Network + High ACR**
   - Active exploitation confirmed, but system is internal (not internet-facing)

**Examples:**

**Example 1: SQL Injection with Public PoC**
- CVE-2024-7890
- CVSS: 8.0 (High)
- EPSS: 0.65 (85th percentile)
- KEV: Not Listed
- Exploit: Public PoC available on GitHub
- System: Internet-facing e-commerce platform
- ACR: High
- **Priority: P2** (High severity + public exploit + important system)

**Example 2: Internal Critical System, High CVSS**
- CVE-2024-1111
- CVSS: 9.5 (Critical)
- EPSS: 0.20 (low exploitation probability)
- KEV: Not Listed
- System: Internal finance database
- ACR: Critical
- Exposure: Internal network only
- **Priority: P2** (Critical system despite lower exploitability)

**SLA Timeline:** 7 days from enrichment completion

**Actions Required:**
- Notify security team and system owners
- Schedule patch deployment within 7 days
- Implement monitoring and compensating controls until patched
- Document remediation plan
- Verify patch applied successfully

**Review Requirement:** Mandatory peer review

---

### P3 - Medium (30 Day SLA)

   - Medium severity + moderate exploitability + internal system

2. **CVSS ≥7.0 + EPSS <0.25 + Effective Compensating Controls**
   - High CVSS but low exploitability with mitigations in place

3. **Medium ACR + CVSS 4.0-6.9 + No Public Exploit**
   - Standard business system, moderate severity, theoretical risk

**Examples:**

## Factor Weighting

### Priority Calculation Algorithm

```python
def calculate_priority(vuln, system):
    score = 0

    # Factor 1: CVSS (0-4 points)
    if vuln.cvss >= 9.0: score += 4
    elif vuln.cvss >= 7.0: score += 3
    elif vuln.cvss >= 4.0: score += 2
    else: score += 1

    # Factor 2: EPSS (0-4 points)
    if vuln.epss >= 0.75: score += 4
    elif vuln.epss >= 0.50: score += 3
    elif vuln.epss >= 0.25: score += 2
    else: score += 1

    # Factor 3: KEV (0-5 points, OVERRIDE)
    if vuln.kev_status == "Listed": score += 5

    # Factor 4: Asset Criticality Rating (0-4 points)
    acr_points = {"Critical": 4, "High": 3, "Medium": 2, "Low": 1}
    score += acr_points[system.acr]

    # Factor 5: System Exposure (0-3 points)
    exposure_points = {"Internet": 3, "Internal": 2, "Isolated": 1}
    score += exposure_points[system.exposure]

    # Factor 6: Exploit Availability (0-4 points)
    exploit_points = {
        "Active Exploitation": 4,
        "Public Exploit": 3,
        "PoC": 2,
        "Theoretical": 1
    }
    score += exploit_points[vuln.exploit_status]

    # Map score to priority (max 24 points)
    if score >= 20 or vuln.kev_status == "Listed":
        return "P1"
    elif score >= 15:
        return "P2"
    elif score >= 10:
        return "P3"
    elif score >= 5:
        return "P4"
    else:
        return "P5"
```

### Factor Weights Summary

| Factor | Weight | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| CVSS | 4 points | Severity matters, but not alone |
| EPSS | 4 points | Exploitability is equally important as severity |
| KEV | 5 points | Active exploitation is strongest signal (override) |
| ACR | 4 points | Business impact is critical |
| Exposure | 3 points | Internet-facing = higher risk |
| Exploit | 4 points | Exploit availability = imminent risk |

**Total Max Score:** 24 points

---

## Priority Modifiers (Override Rules)

### Automatic Priority Elevation (+1 or +2 levels)

**Compliance Requirement:**
- PCI-DSS Critical vulnerability: Elevate to P1 or P2
- HIPAA-regulated system: Elevate +1 level

**Previous Breach:**
- Similar vulnerability exploited in past: Elevate +1 level
- Same product/vendor as previous breach: Elevate +1 level

**Executive Mandate:**
- CEO/CIO/CISO mandate: Elevate to specified priority
- Board-level concern: Elevate to P1 or P2

**Ransomware Threat:**
- KEV with known ransomware use: Elevate to P1

---

### Priority Reduction (-1 level)

**Effective Compensating Controls:**
- WAF with virtual patching: Reduce -1 level
- Network segmentation isolates vulnerable system: Reduce -1 level
- System not accessible to attackers: Reduce -1 level

**Scheduled Decommissioning:**
- System decommissioning within 30 days: Reduce to P5
- System decommissioning within 90 days: Reduce -1 level

**Vendor End-of-Life (No Patch):**
- No patch available, vendor EOL: Consider risk acceptance (P5)
- Migration to supported version planned: Maintain current priority

---

## SLA Enforcement

### SLA Deadlines

| Priority | SLA Timeline | Calculation |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| P1 | 24 hours | Enrichment timestamp + 24 hours |
| P2 | 7 days | Enrichment timestamp + 7 days |
| P3 | 30 days | Enrichment timestamp + 30 days |
| P4 | 90 days | Enrichment timestamp + 90 days |
| P5 | No SLA | N/A |

### SLA Tracking

**Deadline Calculation Example:**
- Enrichment completed: 2025-11-06 10:30:00 UTC
- Priority: P1 (24 hours)
- SLA Deadline: 2025-11-07 10:30:00 UTC

**SLA Breach:**
- Definition: Remediation not completed by deadline
- Action: Escalate to management, document reason for delay

## Quick Reference Table

| Priority | CVSS | EPSS | KEV | ACR | Exposure | SLA | Review |
|----------|------|------|-----|-----|----------|-----|--------|
| P1 | 9.0+ | 0.75+ | Listed | Critical | Internet | 24h | 100% |
| P2 | 7.0+ | 0.50+ | Listed or Exploit | High | Internet/Internal | 7d | 100% |
| P3 | 4.0-6.9 | 0.25-0.49 | Not Listed | Medium | Internal | 30d | 25% |
| P4 | <4.0 | Any | Not Listed | Low | Any | 90d | 10% |
| P5 | <2.0 | Any | Not Listed | Low | Test/Decom | None | 5% |

```

### Testing

**Test Location:** `expansion-packs/bmad-1898-engineering/data/`

**Test Standards:**
- Test priority calculation with real CVEs
- Verify SLA deadline calculation
- Test priority modifiers
- Validate against manual expert assessment

**Test Cases:**
1. Calculate priority for 20 real CVEs: Does algorithm match expert judgment?
2. Test override rules: KEV should always elevate to P1/P2
3. Test modifiers: Compliance requirement elevates priority correctly
4. SLA calculation: Deadlines calculated accurately
