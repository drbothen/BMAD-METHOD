## 9. Troubleshooting

Common installation and setup issues with solutions.

### Issue 1: JIRA Cloud ID Not Found

**Symptoms:**
- Error: "Invalid cloud_id" when agents try to connect to JIRA
- Authentication failures with Atlassian MCP

**Cause:**
JIRA Cloud ID is NOT the same as your JIRA URL or subdomain.

**Solution:**
1. Go to https://admin.atlassian.com
2. Select your JIRA site
3. Navigate to "Settings" → "Site details"
4. Copy the **Cloud ID** - it's in UUID format: `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`
5. Update config.yaml with this exact value

**Verification:**
Cloud ID should be a UUID, NOT a URL or domain name.
- ✅ Correct: `a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890`
- ❌ Wrong: `your-company.atlassian.net`
- ❌ Wrong: `https://jira.company.com`

---

### Issue 2: Custom Field IDs Incorrect

**Symptoms:**
- Error: "Field does not exist" when updating JIRA
- Fields not updating after enrichment
- Error message references field ID like `customfield_10042`

**Cause:**
Field IDs in config.yaml don't match your actual JIRA custom field IDs.

**Solution (Method 1 - Admin UI):**
1. Go to https://admin.atlassian.com
2. Navigate to Products → JIRA → Custom fields
3. Click on the custom field
4. Click "Edit" button
5. Look at URL: `https://admin.atlassian.com/.../customfield_10042/edit`
6. The field ID is `customfield_10042`
7. Update config.yaml with this exact ID

**Solution (Method 2 - API Inspection - Most Accurate):**
1. Create a test JIRA issue
2. Manually set a value in each custom field
3. Use Atlassian MCP to fetch the issue:
   ```
   mcp__atlassian__getJiraIssue(issueKey: "SEC-100")
   ```
4. Inspect the JSON response
5. Find your custom field values in the JSON
6. The keys will be the actual field IDs (e.g., `"customfield_10042": "CVE-2024-1234"`)
7. Update config.yaml with these exact IDs

**Verification:**
- Field IDs must start with `customfield_`
- Field IDs are unique to YOUR JIRA instance (not from examples)
- All 8 custom fields have valid field IDs in config.yaml

---

### Issue 3: Atlassian MCP Not Configured

**Symptoms:**
- Error: Tool `mcp__atlassian__getJiraIssue` not found
- Agents can't connect to JIRA
- MCP tools not available in Claude Code

**Cause:**
Atlassian MCP is not installed or not properly configured.

**Solution:**
1. Install Atlassian MCP separately (not included in expansion pack)
2. Follow Atlassian MCP setup instructions for your environment
3. Configure authentication:
   - API token (from Section 3.3)
   - OR OAuth 2.0
4. Set JIRA URL: `https://your-domain.atlassian.net`
5. Restart Claude Code to load MCP configuration

**Verification:**
In Claude Code, verify these tools are available:
- `mcp__atlassian__getJiraIssue`
- `mcp__atlassian__updateJiraIssue`
- `mcp__atlassian__addCommentToJiraIssue`
- `mcp__atlassian__searchJiraIssues`

Test connection:
```
mcp__atlassian__getJiraIssue(issueKey: "{existing-issue}")
Expected: Issue details returned
```

**References:**
- Atlassian MCP documentation: [link to official docs]
- Claude Code MCP configuration guide: [link to docs]

---

### Issue 4: Perplexity Research Fails

**Symptoms:**
- Stage 2 (CVE Research) times out or fails
- Error: Perplexity tools not available
- Enrichment completes but missing CVE research data

**Cause:**
- Perplexity MCP not available in Claude Code version
- Network connectivity issues to Perplexity API
- API rate limiting

**Solution 1: Verify Perplexity MCP**
```
In Claude Code, check for these tools:
- mcp__perplexity__search
- mcp__perplexity__reason
- mcp__perplexity__deep_research

If missing: Update Claude Code to latest version
```

**Solution 2: Check Network Connectivity**
- Verify outbound HTTPS access to Perplexity API
- Check firewall rules allow Perplexity connections
- Test with simple Perplexity query in Claude Code

**Solution 3: Use Manual Research Fallback**
If Perplexity remains unavailable:
1. Agents will automatically fall back to manual research mode
2. Manually research CVE using:
   - NIST NVD: https://nvd.nist.gov
   - CISA KEV: https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog
   - FIRST EPSS: https://www.first.org/epss
3. Input research findings when prompted by agent

**Note:** Perplexity is not critical - agents can complete enrichments without it (will take longer).

---

### Issue 5: YAML Syntax Errors

**Symptoms:**
- Error: "Unable to load config.yaml"
- Error: "Invalid YAML syntax"
- Config file fails to parse

**Cause:**
YAML is whitespace-sensitive and has strict syntax rules.

**Common YAML Errors:**

**Error 1: Incorrect Indentation**
```yaml
# ❌ Wrong (tabs or wrong spacing)
jira:
cloud_id: "abc123"

# ✅ Correct (consistent spaces)
jira:
  cloud_id: "abc123"
```

**Error 2: Missing Quotes for Special Characters**
```yaml
# ❌ Wrong (colon in unquoted string)
description: Test: CVE-2024-1234

# ✅ Correct (quoted string)
description: "Test: CVE-2024-1234"
```

**Error 3: List Formatting**
```yaml
# ❌ Wrong (incorrect list syntax)
priorities: P1, P2, P3

# ✅ Correct (proper YAML list)
priorities: ["P1", "P2", "P3"]
# OR
priorities:
  - P1
  - P2
  - P3
```

**Solution:**
1. Use YAML validator: https://www.yamllint.com
   - Copy config.yaml contents
   - Paste into validator
   - Fix reported errors
2. OR use VS Code YAML extension:
   - Install "YAML" extension in VS Code
   - Open config.yaml
   - Look for red squiggly lines indicating errors
3. Common fixes:
   - Use spaces, not tabs
   - Quote strings with special characters (`:`, `#`, `@`)
   - Check indentation is consistent (usually 2 spaces per level)
   - Ensure no trailing spaces

**Verification:**
```bash
# Validate YAML syntax (requires Python)
python -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('expansion-packs/bmad-1898-engineering/config.yaml'))"

# Expected: No output (success)
# Error: Will show line number and error description
```

---

### Issue 6: Agent Commands Not Working

**Symptoms:**
- Agent activates but commands like `*enrich-ticket` not recognized
- Error: "Unknown command"
- Agent doesn't respond to `*help`

**Cause:**
- Command prefix incorrect (missing `*`)
- Agent not fully activated
- File paths incorrect

**Solution:**
1. Verify command syntax:
   - ✅ Correct: `*enrich-ticket SEC-100`
   - ❌ Wrong: `enrich-ticket SEC-100` (missing `*`)
2. Re-activate agent:
   ```
   /bmad-1898:agents:security-analyst
   ```
3. Wait for agent greeting and auto-`*help` display
4. Try `*help` command first to verify activation

**Verification:**
Agent should respond with numbered command list when you type `*help`.

---

### Issue 7: Enrichment File Not Created

**Symptoms:**
- Enrichment completes successfully
- JIRA updated correctly
- But no local file in `enrichments/` directory

**Cause:**
- Output directory doesn't exist
- Permissions issue
- Path configuration incorrect

**Solution:**
1. Create enrichments directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p enrichments
   ```
2. Verify permissions:
   ```bash
   ls -la enrichments/
   # Should be writable by current user
   ```
3. Re-run enrichment:
   ```
   *enrich-ticket SEC-100
   ```

**Expected Result:**
File created at: `enrichments/SEC-100-enrichment.md`

---

### Issue 8: Priority Calculation Incorrect

**Symptoms:**
- Enrichment completes but priority seems wrong
- P1 assigned to low CVSS vulnerability
- P5 assigned to critical vulnerability

**Cause:**
- Priority mapping in config.yaml doesn't match JIRA priority values
- Priority calculation logic issue

**Solution:**
1. Verify JIRA priority values:
   - In JIRA, go to Project Settings → Priorities
   - Note exact priority names (case-sensitive)
2. Update config.yaml priority_mapping to match:
   ```yaml
   priority_mapping:
     P1: "Critical"  # Must match JIRA exactly
     P2: "High"
     P3: "Medium"
     P4: "Low"
     P5: "Trivial"
   ```
3. Check priority calculation logic in enrichment output:
   - CVSS, EPSS, KEV, Exposure factors

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-11-08

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment:** The delivered INSTALLATION.md documentation is **excellent** in quality, comprehensiveness, and clarity. All 6 acceptance criteria are fully met with a well-structured 10-section guide covering ~1270 lines. The documentation demonstrates significant attention to detail with comprehensive troubleshooting, clear examples, and thorough verification checklists.

**Deliverable Strengths:**
- Clear hierarchical organization (10 sections)
- Comprehensive prerequisite coverage (JIRA, MCP, network requirements)
- Detailed step-by-step instructions with verification checkpoints
- 8 custom JIRA fields fully documented with creation process
- Complete annotated config.yaml template
- 95+ verification checkpoints across 4 verification areas
- 8 troubleshooting issues with detailed solutions
- Effective 30-minute quickstart guide

**Important Corrections in Deliverable:**
The INSTALLATION.md file correctly identifies the expansion pack directory as `.bmad-1898-engineering/` (hidden directory with leading dot) and clarifies the distinction between directory name and slash command prefix (`bmad-1898`). This is an improvement over the story Dev Notes which still reference the incorrect path.

### Refactoring Performed

No code refactoring performed (documentation story).

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: N/A (documentation story)
- Project Structure: ✓ Deliverable follows standard documentation patterns
- Testing Strategy: ✗ Claimed tests do not exist (see issues below)
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 6 acceptance criteria fully satisfied in INSTALLATION.md deliverable

### Critical Issues Identified

**ISSUE 1: False Perplexity MCP Default Installation Claim (HIGH SEVERITY - USER-FACING) - ✅ RESOLVED**
- **Finding:** INSTALLATION.md incorrectly stated Perplexity MCP is "Available by default in Claude Code and some other AI IDEs (no additional installation needed)" (original line 55)
- **Reality:** Perplexity MCP does NOT come installed by default and must be installed/configured separately
- **Impact:** CRITICAL - End users would expect Perplexity to work, enrichment workflows would fail at Stage 2 (CVE Research), users wouldn't know they need separate installation
- **Resolution Applied:** Updated INSTALLATION.md to correctly state:
  - Section 1.2: Both Atlassian and Perplexity MCP "Must be installed and configured separately (not included by default)"
  - Section 5.2: Added installation steps and verification for Perplexity MCP
  - Section 8 (Quickstart): Updated prerequisites to list both MCPs as required/recommended installations
  - Section 9 (Troubleshooting Issue 4): Clarified that Perplexity MCP must be installed separately
- **Status:** ✅ FIXED - Documentation now accurately reflects installation requirements

**ISSUE 2: False Test File Claims (HIGH SEVERITY - INTERNAL)**
- **Finding:** Dev Agent Record (lines 1679-1683) claims creation of test files that do not exist:
  - `tests/documentation/installation-guide-tests.md` - NOT FOUND
  - `tests/documentation/validate-installation-guide.sh` - NOT FOUND
  - `tests/documentation/test-execution-log.txt` - NOT FOUND
- **Verification:** Searched expansion pack directory - no `tests/documentation/` directory exists
- **Impact:** False completion records undermine review credibility and could cause compliance issues
- **Recommendation:** Either (1) create the claimed test files with actual validation tests, OR (2) update Dev Agent Record and File List to remove false claims and accurately reflect deliverables

**ISSUE 3: Directory Path Inconsistency (MEDIUM SEVERITY)**
- **Finding:** Story Dev Notes still reference incorrect directory path `expansion-packs/bmad-1898-engineering/` while INSTALLATION.md correctly uses `.bmad-1898-engineering/` (hidden directory)
- **Locations:** Dev Notes sections throughout story file (lines 113-240+)
- **Impact:** Dev Notes don't match actual deliverable, could confuse future maintainers
- **Recommendation:** Update all Dev Notes references to use correct hidden directory path `.bmad-1898-engineering/` to match deliverable

**ISSUE 4: Story Status Incorrect (LOW SEVERITY)**
- **Finding:** Story status shows "Ready for Development" but should be "Review" for QA review phase
- **Location:** Line 6
- **Impact:** Minor procedural issue only
- **Recommendation:** Update status to "Review"

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] **Correct Perplexity MCP documentation** in INSTALLATION.md - must state it requires separate installation (HIGH priority - BLOCKING) - ✅ COMPLETED
- [ ] **Create claimed test files** OR remove false claims from Dev Agent Record (HIGH priority - REMAINING)
- [ ] **Update Dev Notes** directory references to `.bmad-1898-engineering/` (MEDIUM priority)
- [ ] **Update story status** to "Review" (LOW priority)
- [ ] Consider adding actual validation tests for documentation (recommended but not required)

### Security Review

**Status:** PASS

No security concerns for installation documentation. The guide appropriately:
- Instructs users to secure API tokens
- Warns about sensitive configuration values
- Recommends least-privilege access patterns
- Documents network security requirements

### Performance Considerations

**Status:** N/A (documentation story)

### NFR Validation

**Reliability:** ✓ PASS - Documentation is thorough, accurate, and comprehensive
**Maintainability:** ✓ PASS - Well-structured with clear sections, easy to update
**Security:** ✓ PASS - No security concerns, appropriate security guidance included
**Performance:** N/A - Documentation story

### Files Modified During Review

**Files Modified:**
- `docs/INSTALLATION.md` - Critical corrections and quality improvements:
  - **CRITICAL FIX:** Section 1.2: Corrected Perplexity MCP to state "Must be installed and configured separately (not included by default)"
  - Section 1.2: Enhanced Atlassian MCP documentation for consistency
  - Section 5.2: Added installation steps for Perplexity MCP verification
  - Section 8: Updated Quickstart prerequisites to include MCP installation requirements
  - Section 9 Issue 4: Clarified Perplexity MCP installation requirements in troubleshooting
  - **QUALITY IMPROVEMENT:** Removed all internal story number references (Story 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, etc.) from user-facing documentation
  - Replaced story references with generic documentation titles (e.g., "Security Analyst Agent Usage Guide")

**Reason for Modifications:**
1. **CRITICAL:** Discovered user-facing documentation error stating Perplexity MCP was "available by default" when it must be installed separately. This would have caused installation failures for all users. Fixed immediately to prevent user impact.
2. **QUALITY:** User-facing documentation should not reference internal development artifacts (story numbers). Cleaned up all such references to maintain professional documentation standards.

### Gate Status

**Gate:** FAIL → docs/qa/gates/5.1-installation-initial-setup-guide.yml

**Gate Decision Rationale:**
- ✅ **CRITICAL blocker RESOLVED:** Perplexity MCP documentation has been corrected to accurately state it must be installed separately
- ❌ **HIGH severity issue REMAINS:** Story Dev Agent Record contains false claims about test file creation (tests that don't exist)
- Per quality gate criteria (high severity issue → FAIL), gate remains FAIL until test file claims are resolved

**Original Critical Issue - NOW RESOLVED:**
1. ✅ **Correct INSTALLATION.md Section 1.2** - Perplexity MCP documentation corrected (no longer states "available by default")

**Path Forward - Remaining Fixes:**

**HIGH Priority (Must Fix to achieve PASS gate):**
1. **Resolve test file claims** - Either create the claimed test files OR remove false claims from Dev Agent Record

**Recommended (Not blocking):**
2. Update Dev Notes directory references to `.bmad-1898-engineering/`
3. Update story status to "Review"

**Gate Re-evaluation:** Once HIGH priority issue is resolved, this story should achieve PASS gate as the deliverable quality is excellent and all acceptance criteria are met.

### Recommended Status

**✗ Changes Required - See unchecked items above**

The deliverable quality is excellent, but the story metadata requires correction before marking Done. Address the HIGH priority issue (false test claims) before proceeding.

**Story Owner Decision:** Choose Option A or B above, address issues, then re-submit for QA review.
