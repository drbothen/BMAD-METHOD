**Orchestration Task:** `expansion-packs/bmad-1898-engineering/tasks/enrich-security-ticket.md`

### 8-Stage Workflow Technical Specifications

**Overall Workflow:**
- **ID:** security-alert-enrichment-v1
- **Estimated Duration:** 10-15 minutes (95th percentile)
- **Prerequisites:** JIRA ticket, Atlassian MCP, Perplexity MCP, Security Analyst agent
- **Success Metrics:** <15 min total, all 8 stages complete, quality score >75%

---

**Stage 1: Triage & Context Extraction**
- **Duration:** 1-2 minutes
- **Inputs:**
  - JIRA ticket ID (format: PROJECT-NUMBER, e.g., AOD-1234)
- **Actions:**
  1. Call `mcp__atlassian__getJiraIssue` with ticket ID
  2. Extract CVE ID from summary/description using regex: `CVE-\d{4}-\d{4,}`
  3. Parse affected systems from custom field or description
  4. Extract initial severity if available
  5. Retrieve Asset Criticality Rating and System Exposure from custom fields
- **Outputs:**
  - CVE ID (validated format)
  - Affected systems list
  - Initial context (severity, ACR, exposure if available)
  - Ticket metadata (reporter, created date, project)
- **Success Criteria:**
  - CVE ID successfully extracted
  - JIRA ticket accessible (no permission errors)
  - Affected systems identified (or marked as TBD)
- **Error Handling:**
  - **CVE Not Found:** Prompt user "CVE ID not found in ticket. Please provide CVE ID or description:"
  - **Ticket Not Found:** Verify ticket ID format and permissions, retry with corrected ID
  - **Permission Denied:** Check JIRA permissions, ensure API token has read access
  - **Multiple CVEs:** Extract all, prompt user to select which CVE to enrich (or enrich all sequentially)
- **Performance Optimization:**
  - Cache JIRA tickets for batch enrichments (avoid redundant MCP calls)
  - Pre-validate ticket ID format before MCP call
  - Use JIRA query to fetch multiple tickets at once for batch operations
- **Common Issues:**
  - Regex fails for non-standard CVE format (e.g., "CVE 2024 1234" with spaces) → Normalize input
  - Affected systems in description text not structured → Manual extraction required

---

**Stage 2: AI-Assisted CVE Research**
- **Duration:** 3-5 minutes (High), 1-2 minutes (Low), 5-10 minutes (Critical)
- **Inputs:**
  - CVE ID
  - CVSS severity (if available from Stage 1)
- **Actions:**
  1. Determine Perplexity tool selection based on severity:
     - CVSS 9.0-10.0 (Critical): `mcp__perplexity__deep_research` (comprehensive, slower)
     - CVSS 7.0-8.9 (High): `mcp__perplexity__reason` (analytical, moderate)
     - CVSS < 7.0 or Unknown (Medium/Low): `mcp__perplexity__search` (quick)
  2. Construct research query:
     ```
     "CVE-{cve_id} vulnerability comprehensive analysis:
     - CVSS v3.1 score and vector string
     - EPSS exploitation probability score
     - CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog status
     - Affected product versions (full version ranges)
     - Patched versions (specific version numbers)
     - Exploit availability (PoC, active exploitation, exploit code published)
     - Active exploitation status (observed in wild, threat actor attribution)
     - MITRE ATT&CK framework mapping (tactics and techniques with T-numbers)
     - Remediation guidance (patch instructions, workarounds, compensating controls)
     - Authoritative sources (NIST NVD, CISA, vendor advisories, CVE.org)"
     ```
  3. Execute Perplexity research with selected tool
  4. Parse and structure research findings
  5. Validate core metrics (CVSS, EPSS) against known ranges
  6. Extract authoritative source URLs
- **Outputs:**
  - CVSS score (0.0-10.0) and vector string (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/...)
  - EPSS score (0.0-100.0%)
  - CISA KEV status (Yes/No, date added if applicable)
  - Affected versions (product name, version ranges)
  - Patched versions (specific version numbers)
  - Exploit status (Active/PoC/None/Unknown)
  - Threat intelligence (active exploitation, threat actors)
  - MITRE ATT&CK suggestions (tactics, techniques, T-numbers)
  - Authoritative source URLs (NVD, CISA, vendor advisories)
- **Success Criteria:**
  - CVSS score obtained and validated (0.0-10.0)
  - Patch status determined (patched version or "no patch available")
  - At least 3 authoritative sources cited
  - Research completed within 2x expected time for severity level
- **Error Handling:**
  - **Perplexity Timeout:** Retry with simpler query (reduce detail requirements)
  - **Rate Limiting:** Wait 30 seconds, retry with exponential backoff
  - **Insufficient Data (new CVE):** Document as "Preliminary - awaiting NVD publication", use vendor advisory if available
  - **CVSS Not Available:** Estimate from description or mark as "TBD - pending NVD analysis"
  - **No Patch Available:** Document workarounds and compensating controls only
- **Performance Optimization:**
  - For P4/P5 (Low/Trivial): Always use `search` regardless of CVSS (trade depth for speed)
  - For batch enrichments: Cache research for identical CVEs
  - For related CVEs (same product): Reuse vendor advisory and general vulnerability info
  - Adjust query complexity based on time constraints
- **Common Issues:**
  - Perplexity returns generic vulnerability info, not specific CVE details → Add "CVE-{id} specific details" to query
  - EPSS score outdated (>7 days old) → Note in enrichment, mark for re-check
  - Conflicting CVSS scores (NVD vs. vendor) → Document both, explain discrepancy

---

**Stage 3: Business Context Assessment**
- **Duration:** 2-3 minutes
- **Inputs:**
  - Affected systems (from Stage 1)
  - CVE intelligence (from Stage 2)
  - JIRA custom fields (ACR, Exposure)
- **Actions:**
  1. Retrieve Asset Criticality Rating from JIRA custom field `asset_criticality_rating`
  2. If ACR not in JIRA, check config.yaml for default or prompt user
  3. Retrieve System Exposure from JIRA custom field `system_exposure`
  4. If Exposure not in JIRA, infer from system name or prompt user
  5. Assess business impact based on ACR + Exposure + CVE type:
     - High ACR + Internet Exposure + RCE = Critical business impact
     - Medium ACR + Internal + SQLi = Moderate business impact
  6. Identify affected business processes (e.g., "E-commerce checkout", "Customer database")
  7. Document business impact in clear, non-technical language for stakeholders
- **Outputs:**
  - Asset Criticality Rating (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
  - System Exposure classification (Internet/Internal/Isolated)
  - Business impact analysis (2-3 sentences)
  - Affected business processes list
  - Stakeholders to notify
- **Success Criteria:**
  - ACR rating determined (populated or defaulted)
  - System Exposure classified
  - Business impact articulated clearly
- **Error Handling:**
  - **ACR Unknown:** Default to "Medium" and document assumption, flag for confirmation
  - **Exposure Unknown:** Default to "Internal" (safer assumption), flag for confirmation
  - **Business Processes Unknown:** Use generic based on system type (e.g., "Web server: customer-facing services")
- **Performance Optimization:**
  - Pre-populate ACR and Exposure in JIRA tickets during triage (eliminates prompts)
  - Maintain asset inventory mapping (system name → ACR/Exposure) in config
  - Use CMDB integration if available
- **Common Issues:**
  - Multiple systems with different ACRs → Use highest ACR for conservative priority
  - Exposure classification ambiguous (DMZ) → Treat as Internet-exposed for safety

---

**Stage 4: Remediation Planning**
- **Duration:** 2-3 minutes
- **Inputs:**
  - CVE intelligence (patches, workarounds from Stage 2)
  - Business context (ACR, constraints)
- **Actions:**
  1. Identify primary remediation: Patch version and installation method
  2. Research workarounds if patch not immediately applicable
  3. Identify compensating controls for interim protection
  4. Create step-by-step remediation guidance (specific commands if possible)
  5. Add verification steps to confirm remediation success
  6. Note any business impact of remediation (downtime, testing required)
- **Outputs:**
  - Primary remediation (patch version, upgrade path)
  - Workaround procedures (if patch delayed)
  - Compensating controls (WAF rules, network segmentation, access controls)
  - Remediation steps (actionable, specific)
  - Verification steps (how to confirm fix)
  - Estimated effort and downtime
- **Success Criteria:**
  - Remediation guidance is actionable and specific
  - At least one remediation path provided (patch or workaround)
  - Verification steps included
- **Error Handling:**
  - **No Patch Available:** Focus on workarounds and compensating controls, document as "Mitigation only"
  - **Vendor Advisory Missing:** Use generic upgrade guidance, flag for vendor clarification
  - **Breaking Changes in Patch:** Document rollback plan, testing requirements
- **Performance Optimization:**
  - Reuse remediation templates for common vulnerability types
  - Maintain vendor-specific patch procedure library
  - Leverage Perplexity research from Stage 2 (avoid redundant research)
- **Common Issues:**
  - Patch requires breaking changes (major version upgrade) → Document migration path
  - Multiple remediation options → Prioritize by effort and risk reduction

---

**Stage 5: MITRE ATT&CK Mapping**
- **Duration:** 1-2 minutes
- **Inputs:**
  - CVE intelligence (vulnerability type, attack vector)
  - MITRE ATT&CK suggestions from Perplexity (if available)
- **Actions:**
  1. Identify vulnerability type (RCE, SQLi, XSS, Auth Bypass, etc.)
  2. Map to primary MITRE ATT&CK tactic:
     - RCE, Deserialization → Initial Access or Execution
     - SQLi, Path Traversal → Initial Access or Discovery
     - Privilege Escalation vulns → Privilege Escalation
     - Auth Bypass → Credential Access or Defense Evasion
  3. Map to specific techniques with T-numbers:
     - RCE via public application → T1190 (Exploit Public-Facing Application)
     - Auth bypass → T1078 (Valid Accounts) or T1110 (Brute Force)
  4. Validate T-numbers against MITRE ATT&CK matrix
  5. Add detection implications (what to monitor)
  6. Add defensive recommendations aligned with ATT&CK
- **Outputs:**
  - ATT&CK tactics (1-3 tactics)
  - ATT&CK techniques with T-numbers (1-5 techniques)
  - Detection implications (log sources, signatures, behaviors)
  - Defense recommendations (mitigations, controls)
- **Success Criteria:**
  - At least 1 tactic identified
  - At least 1 technique with valid T-number
  - Detection implications provided
- **Error Handling:**
  - **Unfamiliar Vulnerability Type:** Use general mapping (T1190 for external, T1068 for local)
  - **Mapping Uncertainty:** Document multiple possible techniques, note uncertainty
  - **Invalid T-number from Perplexity:** Validate against MITRE ATT&CK, correct if needed
- **Performance Optimization:**
  - Maintain mapping library (vulnerability type → common T-numbers)
  - Use Perplexity ATT&CK suggestions as starting point, validate quickly
  - For low-priority CVEs (P4/P5): Use generic mappings
- **Common Issues:**
  - Multiple applicable techniques → Include all relevant, prioritize most likely
  - T-number format incorrect (missing T prefix) → Auto-correct to T1234 format

---

**Stage 6: Multi-Factor Priority Assessment**
- **Duration:** 1-2 minutes
- **Inputs:**
  - CVSS score (from Stage 2)
  - EPSS score (from Stage 2)
  - KEV status (from Stage 2)
  - Asset Criticality Rating (from Stage 3)
  - System Exposure (from Stage 3)
  - Exploit Status (from Stage 2)
- **Actions:**
  1. Apply priority algorithm (from priority-framework.md):
     - **P1 (Critical):** (CVSS ≥ 9.0 AND KEV=Yes) OR (CVSS ≥ 9.0 AND Internet+Critical ACR AND Exploit=Active)
     - **P2 (High):** (CVSS ≥ 7.0 AND High ACR) OR (CVSS ≥ 9.0 AND Medium/Low ACR)
     - **P3 (Medium):** (CVSS 4.0-6.9 AND Medium ACR) OR (CVSS 7.0-8.9 AND Low ACR)
     - **P4 (Low):** CVSS < 4.0 OR (Isolated systems AND Exploit=None)
     - **P5 (Trivial):** CVSS < 4.0 AND Low ACR AND Isolated AND No remediation available
  2. Generate priority rationale explaining all factors:
     - "P1: CVSS 9.8 (Critical severity) + CISA KEV listed + Internet-exposed High criticality asset + Active exploitation in wild"
  3. Calculate SLA deadline based on priority:
     - P1: 24 hours
     - P2: 7 days
     - P3: 30 days
     - P4: 90 days
     - P5: Best effort
  4. Validate priority assignment (sanity check for edge cases)
- **Outputs:**
  - Priority level (P1/P2/P3/P4/P5)
  - Priority rationale (explains all contributing factors)
  - SLA deadline (timestamp)
  - Risk summary (1-2 sentences)
- **Success Criteria:**
  - Priority assigned with clear rationale
  - Rationale references all major factors
  - SLA deadline calculated correctly
- **Error Handling:**
  - **Missing Factors:** Use conservative defaults (assume higher risk)
  - **Conflicting Signals:** Document conflict, use most conservative priority
  - **Edge Cases:** Flag for manual review if automated logic uncertain
- **Performance Optimization:**
  - Pre-calculate priority matrix for common factor combinations
  - Automated priority calculation (no manual intervention for clear cases)
- **Common Issues:**
  - CVSS 6.9 vs 7.0 threshold edge case → Apply algorithm strictly, document in rationale
  - KEV=Yes but CVSS=Medium → KEV overrides lower CVSS (escalate priority)

---

**Stage 7: Structured Documentation**
- **Duration:** 1 minute (automated)
- **Inputs:**
  - All enrichment data from Stages 1-6
- **Actions:**
  1. Load template: `templates/security-enrichment-tmpl.yaml`
  2. Populate all 12 template sections:
     1. Executive Summary (2-3 sentences: CVE, CVSS, priority, SLA)
     2. Vulnerability Details (CVE, title, type, versions)
     3. Severity Metrics (CVSS, EPSS, KEV)
     4. Affected Systems & Versions
     5. Remediation Guidance
     6. MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
     7. Business Impact Assessment
     8. Threat Intelligence
     9. Verification & Testing
     10. References & Sources
     11. Related CVEs
     12. Analyst Notes
  3. Validate template completeness (all sections non-empty)
  4. Calculate quality score based on:
     - Completeness (all sections present)
     - Source citations (authoritative sources linked)
     - Actionability (clear remediation steps)
  5. Generate markdown document
- **Outputs:**
  - Enrichment markdown document (12 sections)
  - Quality score (0-100)
  - Validation status (pass/fail)
- **Success Criteria:**
  - All 12 sections populated
  - Quality score ≥ 75%
  - Executive summary present
- **Error Handling:**
  - **Missing Section:** Populate with placeholder "TBD - requires additional research" and flag
  - **Validation Failure:** List missing sections, prompt for completion
  - **Quality Score < 75%:** List gaps, suggest improvements
- **Performance Optimization:**
  - Template processing is fully automated (no user interaction)
  - Parallel section generation if possible
- **Common Issues:**
  - Related CVEs section empty → Use "None identified" placeholder
  - Verification section generic → Auto-populate with basic "Re-scan after patch" guidance

---

**Stage 8: JIRA Update & Validation**
- **Duration:** 1-2 minutes
- **Inputs:**
  - Enrichment markdown document
  - Priority level
  - Structured data (CVSS, EPSS, KEV, etc.)
- **Actions:**
  1. Post enrichment as JIRA comment using `mcp__atlassian__addCommentToJiraIssue`
     - Format: Markdown (JIRA renders markdown)
     - Content: Full 12-section enrichment
  2. Update JIRA custom fields using `mcp__atlassian__updateJiraIssue`:
     - CVE ID, Affected Systems, ACR, System Exposure
     - CVSS Score, EPSS Score, KEV Status, Exploit Status
  3. Save enrichment to local file: `enrichments/{ticket-id}-enrichment.md`
  4. Append metrics to CSV: `metrics/enrichment-metrics.csv`
     - ticket_id, cve_id, analyst, timestamps, duration, quality_score, priority, etc.
  5. Validate JIRA update success (check API response)
  6. Clean up workflow state file: `.workflow-state/{ticket-id}.json`
- **Outputs:**
  - JIRA comment posted successfully
  - JIRA custom fields updated (8 fields)
  - Local enrichment file saved
  - Metrics CSV entry appended
  - Workflow state cleaned up
- **Success Criteria:**
  - JIRA comment posted (HTTP 200/201)
  - All 8 custom fields updated without errors
  - Local file saved successfully
  - Metrics logged
- **Error Handling:**
  - **JIRA Comment Post Failure:** Save locally, provide manual copy instructions
  - **Custom Field Update Failure:** Identify specific field error (validation, permissions), retry individual fields
  - **Permission Denied:** Verify API token permissions, escalate to JIRA admin
  - **Field Validation Error:** Check field type and constraints, adjust data format
  - **Network Timeout:** Retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts)
- **Performance Optimization:**
  - Batch field updates in single API call if possible
  - Parallel JIRA operations (comment + field updates) if MCP supports
  - Local file write async (don't block on file I/O)
- **Common Issues:**
  - CVSS field expects number but receives string → Type conversion before update
  - Custom field ID incorrect in config.yaml → Verify field IDs, update config
  - Comment too large (>32KB) → Truncate with link to full local file

### Integration Points

**Atlassian MCP (JIRA Operations):**
- **Tools Used:**
  - `mcp__atlassian__getJiraIssue` (Stage 1: Read ticket)
  - `mcp__atlassian__addCommentToJiraIssue` (Stage 8: Post enrichment)
  - `mcp__atlassian__updateJiraIssue` (Stage 8: Update custom fields)
  - `mcp__atlassian__searchJiraIssues` (Optional: Batch enrichment)
- **Configuration:** config.yaml (cloud_id, project_key, custom_fields)
- **Authentication:** API token or OAuth 2.0
- **Error Codes:**
  - 401: Authentication failed → Check API token
  - 403: Permission denied → Check user permissions
  - 404: Ticket not found → Verify ticket ID
  - 400: Validation error → Check field constraints

**Perplexity MCP (CVE Research):**
- **Tools Used:**
  - `mcp__perplexity__search` (Quick research, 1-2 min)
  - `mcp__perplexity__reason` (Analytical research, 3-5 min)
  - `mcp__perplexity__deep_research` (Comprehensive research, 5-10 min)
- **Tool Selection Logic:**
  - CVSS 9.0-10.0 → deep_research
  - CVSS 7.0-8.9 → reason
  - CVSS < 7.0 → search
- **Rate Limiting:** Respect Perplexity API limits, implement backoff
- **Fallback:** Manual research if Perplexity unavailable

**Local File System:**
- **Enrichment Artifacts:** `enrichments/{ticket-id}-enrichment.md`
- **Workflow State:** `.workflow-state/{ticket-id}.json`
- **Metrics:** `metrics/enrichment-metrics.csv`
- **Permissions:** Ensure write access to all directories

**Config.yaml:**
- **JIRA Configuration:** cloud_id, project_key, custom_fields
- **Priority Mapping:** P1-P5 to JIRA priority values
- **Defaults:** Default ACR, default Exposure
- **Validation:** YAML syntax, required fields present

### Workflow State Management

**State File Location:** `.workflow-state/{ticket-id}.json`

**State Structure:**
```json
{
  "ticket_id": "AOD-1234",
  "cve_id": "CVE-2024-1234",
  "current_stage": 3,
  "started_at": "2025-11-08T14:30:00Z",
  "stages": {
    "stage1": {
      "status": "completed",
      "completed_at": "2025-11-08T14:31:23Z",
      "outputs": {
        "cve_id": "CVE-2024-1234",
        "affected_systems": ["prod-web-01"],
        "acr": "High",
        "exposure": "Internet"
      }
    },
    "stage2": {
      "status": "completed",
      "completed_at": "2025-11-08T14:35:35Z",
      "outputs": {
        "cvss": 9.8,
        "epss": 87.34,
        "kev": "Yes",
        "patched_version": "2.5.33+"
      }
    },
    "stage3": {
      "status": "in_progress",
      "started_at": "2025-11-08T14:35:36Z"
    }
  }
}
```

**Resume Capability:**
- If workflow interrupted (error, timeout, user abort), state preserved
- Resume command: `*enrich-ticket AOD-1234 --resume`
- Workflow reads state file, continues from last completed stage
- Completed stage outputs reused (no redundant research)

**State Cleanup:**
- State file deleted after successful Stage 8 completion
- Orphaned state files (>24 hours old) auto-cleaned

**Benefits:**
- Prevents data loss on interruption
- Enables step-by-step debugging
- Allows pausing long enrichments
