## Dev Notes

### Epic Context

**Epic 7: Security Event Investigation Review Capability**

This story creates the review report template that the Security Reviewer agent (Story 7.4) will use when providing feedback on event investigations. This template parallels the existing `security-review-report-tmpl.yaml` (used for CVE reviews) but is tailored to event investigation review needs.

**Key Differences from CVE Review Template:**

1. **Disposition Assessment Section:** Event reviews track whether reviewer agrees with analyst's disposition (TP/FP/BTP) - critical for event investigations
2. **7 Quality Dimensions vs. 8:** Different weighting and focus areas
3. **Automation Bias:** Added to cognitive bias assessment (specific to event investigations)
4. **Investigation Methodology:** Replaces "Actionability" and "Attack Mapping" dimensions

**Related Stories:**

- Story 7.2: Event Investigation Quality Checklists (provides scores for quality_scores section)
- **Story 7.3: Event Investigation Review Report Template** (This story)
- Story 7.4: Security Reviewer Auto-Detection and Event Review (uses this template)

**File to Create:**

- `expansion-packs/bmad-1898-engineering/templates/security-event-investigation-review-report-tmpl.yaml`

### Template Structure (from Epic 7 PRD FR-3)

The template must include these sections as specified in the PRD:

1. **review_metadata:** Ticket, alert, analyst, reviewer identification
2. **executive_summary:** Quality classification, overall score, disposition agreement, summary
3. **strengths:** 3-5 positive aspects acknowledged
4. **quality_scores:** 7 dimension scores + weights + overall score
5. **critical_issues:** Issues requiring immediate correction
6. **significant_gaps:** Important improvements needed
7. **minor_improvements:** Optional enhancements
8. **disposition_assessment:** Analyst vs. reviewer disposition comparison (UNIQUE to event reviews)
9. **cognitive_bias_assessment:** Detected biases, impact, debiasing strategies
10. **recommendations:** Priority actions and investigation improvements
11. **learning_resources:** Educational materials with links
12. **next_steps:** Clear guidance based on review findings

### Disposition Agreement Tracking

This is the key differentiator between CVE review and event investigation review templates.

**Disposition Assessment Section Structure:**

```yaml
disposition_assessment:
  analyst_disposition: '{TP|FP|BTP}'
  reviewer_disposition: '{TP|FP|BTP}'
  agreement: '{yes|no}'
  reasoning: |
    {If disagreement, explain reasoning for alternate disposition
    with specific evidence and logic. If agreement, briefly confirm
    why the disposition is correct.}
```

**Example - Agreement:**

```yaml
disposition_assessment:
  analyst_disposition: 'False Positive'
  reviewer_disposition: 'False Positive'
  agreement: 'yes'
  reasoning: |
    Reviewer agrees with False Positive disposition. The evidence clearly demonstrates:
    - Source IP is authorized jump server (Asset DB verified)
    - SSH connection pattern matches scheduled backup (6 months history confirmed)
    - SSH keys match authorized IT Ops keys (key fingerprint validated)
    - No concurrent suspicious activity detected

    The analyst's conclusion is well-supported and logical.
```

**Example - Disagreement:**

```yaml
disposition_assessment:
  analyst_disposition: 'False Positive'
  reviewer_disposition: 'True Positive'
  agreement: 'no'
  reasoning: |
    Reviewer disagrees with False Positive disposition and believes this is True Positive (Confidence: Medium).

    Evidence supporting True Positive:
    - SSH connection uses non-standard port 2222 (not documented in jump server config)
    - Connection timing does not match scheduled backup window (occurred 14:30 UTC, backups run 02:00 UTC)
    - SSH key fingerprint does not match any authorized keys in IT Ops registry
    - Concurrent failed login attempts on other systems from same source IP (10 failed attempts in past hour)

    The analyst's investigation did not verify the SSH key fingerprint against the key registry
    or check for concurrent suspicious activity. The timing discrepancy and non-standard port
    suggest this may be unauthorized access rather than scheduled maintenance.

    Recommendation: Re-investigate with focus on SSH key validation and timeline correlation.
    Escalate to incident response team for containment assessment.
```

### Blameless Language Patterns

**Template Instructions Must Include:**

```yaml
instructions: |
  When generating this review report:

  BLAMELESS LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS:
  - Always acknowledge strengths BEFORE identifying gaps
  - Use "we" language (collaborative), not "you" language (accusatory)
  - Frame gaps as "opportunities for improvement" not "failures" or "errors"
  - Provide specific, actionable recommendations for every gap
  - Link gaps to learning resources (educational approach)
  - Maintain constructive, respectful tone throughout

  AVOID THESE PATTERNS:
  - "You missed..." → USE: "An opportunity to strengthen this analysis would be adding..."
  - "This is wrong..." → USE: "Consider revising this to reflect..."
  - "You failed to..." → USE: "Including X would make this more comprehensive..."
  - "This is incomplete..." → USE: "This section could benefit from..."
  - "Critical error..." → USE: "Critical issue requiring immediate attention..."

  CONSTRUCTIVE PATTERNS TO USE:
  - "An opportunity to strengthen this analysis would be..."
  - "Adding X would make this more comprehensive..."
  - "Consider including..."
  - "This section could benefit from..."
  - "A helpful addition would be..."
  - "Building on the strong foundation here, we could enhance..."
```

### Weighted Scoring Display

The template must clearly display the weighted scoring calculation:

```yaml
quality_scores:
  investigation_completeness:
    score: '{score}%'
    weight: 25
    weighted_contribution: '{score * 0.25}'
  technical_accuracy:
    score: '{score}%'
    weight: 20
    weighted_contribution: '{score * 0.20}'
  disposition_reasoning:
    score: '{score}%'
    weight: 20
    weighted_contribution: '{score * 0.20}'
  contextualization:
    score: '{score}%'
    weight: 15
    weighted_contribution: '{score * 0.15}'
  methodology:
    score: '{score}%'
    weight: 10
    weighted_contribution: '{score * 0.10}'
  documentation_quality:
    score: '{score}%'
    weight: 5
    weighted_contribution: '{score * 0.05}'
  cognitive_bias:
    score: '{score}%'
    weight: 5
    weighted_contribution: '{score * 0.05}'
  overall_score: '{calculated_score}%'
  quality_classification: '{Excellent|Good|Needs Improvement|Inadequate}'
```

**Example Output:**

```
Quality Scores:
- Investigation Completeness: 95% (Weight: 25%) → 23.75 points
- Technical Accuracy: 86% (Weight: 20%) → 17.20 points
- Disposition Reasoning: 100% (Weight: 20%) → 20.00 points
- Contextualization: 71% (Weight: 15%) → 10.65 points
- Investigation Methodology: 83% (Weight: 10%) → 8.30 points
- Documentation Quality: 83% (Weight: 5%) → 4.15 points
- Cognitive Bias: 100% (Weight: 5%) → 5.00 points

Overall Quality Score: 89.05% (Good)
```

### JIRA Comment Formatting

Template output must render cleanly in JIRA comments:

- Use markdown headers (`##` for sections, `###` for subsections)
- Use bulleted lists (`-` for items)
- Use bold for emphasis (`**text**`)
- Use code blocks for technical content (` ```text``` `)
- Avoid special characters that break JIRA markdown (e.g., `<`, `>` outside code blocks)
- Keep line length reasonable (<120 chars for readability)

### Testing

**Test Scenarios:**

1. Generate review report for excellent investigation (90%+ score)
2. Generate review report for investigation needing improvement (60-74% score)
3. Generate review report with disposition agreement
4. Generate review report with disposition disagreement
5. Validate blameless language patterns in generated output
6. Validate JIRA comment formatting (post to test ticket)
7. Validate weighted scoring calculation accuracy

- Disposition assessment section is the key architectural differentiator from CVE review template
- Blameless language patterns are comprehensive and actionable
- Each section includes clear guidance for LLM generation
- Instructions emphasize constructive, educational approach
- Reviewer notes section adds valuable personal coaching opportunity

**Documentation Excellence:**

- Dev Agent Record is thorough and accurate
- File List properly maintained
- Change Log documents implementation milestone
- All tasks marked complete with clear AC traceability

**Minor Observation (Not Blocking):**

- Lines 186-189, 215, 244 use {{@index}} which displays 0-based indexing (0, 1, 2...)
- Comment on line 186 suggests adding 1 for display (1, 2, 3...)
- This is a cosmetic preference - 0-based indexing is common in engineering contexts
- Recommendation: Accept as-is (engineers prefer 0-based) or implement +1 offset if desired for user-facing display
- **Severity: MINOR** - Does not affect functionality, purely display preference
