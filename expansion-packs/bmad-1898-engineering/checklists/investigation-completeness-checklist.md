# Investigation Completeness Checklist

**Weight:** 25%
**Purpose:** Verify all required investigation steps were performed and documented.

## Check Items

### Alert Metadata (5 items)

- [ ] **Alert Source Documented** - Alert platform/sensor identified (e.g., Claroty, Splunk, Firewall)
- [ ] **Alert Rule ID Captured** - Specific rule or signature ID recorded
- [ ] **Severity Level Stated** - Alert severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low) documented
- [ ] **Detection Timestamp Recorded** - When the alert was generated by the system
- [ ] **Event Occurrence Time Noted** - When the actual event occurred (may differ from detection time)

### Network/Host Identifiers (5 items)

- [ ] **Source IP/Hostname Documented** - Origin of the activity clearly identified
- [ ] **Destination IP/Hostname Documented** - Target of the activity clearly identified
- [ ] **Protocol and Port Information** - Network protocols (TCP/UDP/ICMP) and port numbers specified
- [ ] **Asset Type Identified** - Device/system type (server, workstation, ICS device, network equipment)
- [ ] **Asset Criticality Assessed** - Critical/High/Medium/Low criticality level assigned

### Investigation Steps (5 items)

- [ ] **Relevant Logs Collected** - Appropriate log sources consulted (firewall, SIEM, endpoint, application logs)
- [ ] **Correlation Performed** - Related events identified and analyzed (before/after timeline, same source/dest)
- [ ] **Historical Context Researched** - Past occurrences or patterns reviewed (last 30/60/90 days)
- [ ] **Asset Ownership Confirmed** - System owner or responsible team identified
- [ ] **Business Context Obtained** - Business purpose or function of assets understood

### Evidence & Analysis (4 items)

- [ ] **Evidence Documented** - Log excerpts, screenshots, or other supporting evidence included
- [ ] **Alternative Explanations Considered** - At least 2 alternative scenarios evaluated beyond initial hypothesis
- [ ] **Dead Ends Noted** - Investigation paths that yielded no results documented (negative findings)
- [ ] **Confidence Level Stated** - Investigation confidence explicitly stated (High/Medium/Low)

## Scoring

- **Total Items:** 19
- **Passed Items:** [count after review]
- **Score:** (Passed / 19) × 100 = \_\_\_\_%

## Guidance

### Completeness vs. Over-Investigation

**Appropriate Completeness:**

- All 19 items addressed, even if briefly
- Evidence proportional to alert severity and asset criticality
- Investigation stopped when disposition is clear with high confidence

**Signs of Incomplete Investigation:**

- Missing alert metadata (can't reproduce or validate alert)
- No correlation performed (event analyzed in isolation)
- No historical context (can't distinguish anomaly from baseline)
- No alternative explanations considered (confirmation bias risk)

**Signs of Over-Investigation:**

- Low-severity false positive on non-critical asset with exhaustive forensics
- Extensive investigation after disposition already clear with high confidence
- Collecting excessive evidence that doesn't change disposition

### Example: Complete Investigation

```
Alert Source: Claroty IDS
Alert Rule: SSH_Unusual_Destination_V2 (Rule ID: 4782)
Severity: High
Detection Time: 2024-11-09 14:32:15 UTC
Event Time: 2024-11-09 14:30:00 UTC

Source: 10.50.1.100 (jump-server-01.corp.local) - Authorized jump server, Critical asset
Destination: 10.10.5.25 (file-server-backup.corp.local) - File server, High criticality
Protocol: TCP/22 (SSH)

Investigation Steps:
- Reviewed Claroty logs for full connection details
- Checked firewall logs for 10.50.1.100 activity (last 24h)
- Queried SSH authentication logs on 10.10.5.25
- Reviewed 90-day history: Daily SSH connection at ~02:00 UTC (automated backup)
- Confirmed asset ownership: IT Operations team, backup infrastructure
- Business context: Automated backup operation (critical business function)

Evidence:
- SSH key fingerprint: aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff (matches authorized IT Ops key)
- Historical pattern: 87 occurrences in last 90 days, all at 02:00 UTC ±5 min
- Asset DB confirms jump server role and authorized backup function

Alternative Explanations:
1. Lateral movement after jump server compromise → Ruled out: SSH key fingerprint matches authorized key, no other suspicious activity
2. Insider threat using authorized credentials → Ruled out: Consistent automated timing, no interactive commands, matches documented backup schedule

Dead Ends:
- Checked threat intel for 10.50.1.100 → No matches (internal IP)
- Reviewed jump server for IOCs → Clean (no compromise indicators)

Confidence Level: High
```

### Example: Incomplete Investigation

```
Alert Source: Claroty
Severity: High

Source: 10.50.1.100
Destination: 10.10.5.25
Protocol: SSH

Investigation: This looks like normal SSH traffic between internal systems.

Disposition: False Positive
```

**Missing Items:**

- No alert rule ID
- No timestamps
- No asset identification (hostnames, types, criticality)
- No logs collected or correlation performed
- No historical context
- No asset ownership or business context
- No evidence documented
- No alternative explanations
- No confidence level

**Completeness Score:** 2/19 = 11% (Inadequate)

### Common Gaps

**Missing Alert Metadata (items 1-5):**

- Impact: Can't reproduce alert or validate accuracy
- Fix: Always capture full alert details at start of investigation

**Missing Network Identifiers (items 6-10):**

- Impact: Can't assess risk or validate disposition
- Fix: Document full network context (IPs, hostnames, protocols, asset types)

**Skipping Investigation Steps (items 11-15):**

- Impact: Shallow analysis, missed context, wrong disposition
- Fix: Follow systematic process (logs → correlation → history → ownership → context)

**No Evidence or Alternatives (items 16-19):**

- Impact: Disposition unsupported, bias risk, can't verify conclusions
- Fix: Document evidence, actively seek alternative explanations, note dead ends

### Weighting Rationale

**Why 25% (Highest Weight)?**

Completeness is the foundation of quality. An incomplete investigation cannot be accurate, no matter how well-written or technically sound the documented portions are. Missing any of these 19 items significantly increases the risk of incorrect dispositions.

**Critical Items (Must Have):**

- Alert metadata (enables alert validation and tuning)
- Network identifiers (enables asset identification and risk assessment)
- Evidence documentation (supports disposition and enables verification)
- Alternative explanations (prevents confirmation bias)

**Investigation Failure Modes:**

- Most false positives missed: Incomplete correlation or historical context
- Most false negatives generated: Insufficient evidence collection or no alternatives considered
- Most incorrect escalations: Missing business context or asset criticality
