    "description": "# Alert Overview\n\n**Alert Source**: Claroty Industrial Cybersecurity Platform\n**Alert Type**: ICS Protocol Violation\n**Severity**: High\n**Detection Time**: 2025-11-08 14:15:32 EST\n**Alert ID**: CLR-2025-110814-SSH-001\n\n## Alert Description\n\nClaroty detected an SSH connection (TCP port 22) originating from a maintenance workstation (10.50.10.45) to a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) in the SCADA network (172.16.5.20). This connection was flagged because:\n\n1. SSH is not a typical ICS protocol for PLC communication\n2. The connection occurred outside of scheduled maintenance windows\n3. The destination PLC controls critical water treatment processes\n\n## Network Identifiers\n\n**Source Information:**\n- IP Address: 10.50.10.45\n- Hostname: MAINT-WS-003\n- MAC Address: 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E\n- Network Segment: Maintenance VLAN (VLAN 50)\n- Asset Owner: Facilities Engineering Team\n\n**Destination Information:**\n- IP Address: 172.16.5.20\n- Hostname: PLC-WATER-TREATMENT-02\n- MAC Address: 00:50:C2:7A:8B:9C\n- Device Type: Allen-Bradley ControlLogix PLC\n- Network Segment: SCADA Control Network (VLAN 5)\n- Asset Owner: Water Treatment Operations\n- Criticality: CRITICAL (controls chlorine dosing and pH adjustment)\n\n**Connection Details:**\n- Protocol: SSH (TCP)\n- Source Port: 54382 (ephemeral)\n- Destination Port: 22 (SSH)\n- Connection Duration: 47 minutes\n- Data Transferred: 12.3 KB outbound, 8.7 KB inbound\n- Authentication Method: SSH key-based authentication\n- Username: svc_plc_maint\n\n## Timeline\n\n- **2025-11-08 14:15:32** - SSH connection initiated from 10.50.10.45 to 172.16.5.20:22\n- **2025-11-08 14:15:35** - SSH authentication successful (key-based)\n- **2025-11-08 14:16:00** - Claroty baseline violation alert triggered\n- **2025-11-08 14:23:45** - JIRA ticket created automatically\n- **2025-11-08 15:02:18** - SSH connection terminated\n\n## Additional Context\n\n**Recent Related Activity:**\n- No other SSH connections to this PLC in the past 30 days\n- Last scheduled maintenance window: 2025-11-01 02:00-06:00 (completed)\n- Next scheduled maintenance window: 2025-11-15 02:00-06:00\n\n**Asset Context:**\n- PLC firmware version: 20.011\n- PLC last configuration change: 2025-10-28 03:15:42\n- Known vulnerabilities: None (firmware up-to-date)\n\n**User Context:**\n- svc_plc_maint is an authorized service account for PLC maintenance\n- Account has privileged access to SCADA network\n- Account typically used only during scheduled maintenance windows\n\n## Disposition Options\n\n1. **True Positive**: Unauthorized access attempt or malicious activity\n2. **False Positive**: Authorized emergency maintenance or troubleshooting\n3. **Benign True Positive**: Authorized activity but policy violation (unscheduled maintenance)\n\n## Investigation Requirements\n\n- Verify if emergency maintenance was authorized\n- Check change management tickets for unscheduled maintenance approvals\n- Interview facilities engineering team about the connection\n- Review SSH session logs for commands executed\n- Validate no unauthorized configuration changes to PLC\n- Assess impact to water treatment operations during connection\n",
