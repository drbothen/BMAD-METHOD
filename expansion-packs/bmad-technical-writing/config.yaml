  Production-ready AI-powered technical writing framework for technical book
  authors, technical trainers, and documentation specialists. Provides 13
  specialized agents (10 required + 3 optional), 15 workflows, and comprehensive
  quality assurance tools for planning, writing, revising, reviewing, and
  publishing technical books with code examples, tutorials, and learning
  objectives. Includes 31 checklists for technical accuracy, security,
  performance, publisher compliance, accessibility, visual quality, documentation,
  cross-platform compatibility, inclusive language, readability, indexing,
  citations, final manuscript review, book proposals, self-publishing standards,
  repository quality, and MEAP readiness. 18 professional templates cover book
  planning, chapter development, API reference, diagrams, publishing, book
  analysis, revision planning, and glossary entries. 33 tasks handle all
  authoring workflows from learning path design to version matrix testing,
  code repository setup, solutions creation, index generation, screenshot
  management, publisher packaging, MEAP preparation, self-publishing prep,
  preface/appendix creation, diagram set design, and cross-reference validation.
  Section-driven workflows enable incremental chapter development (2-5 pages per
  section) with parallel development capabilities. Brownfield support enables
  2nd/3rd edition updates, technology version migrations, chapter additions to
  existing books, and systematic reviewer feedback incorporation. Optional agents
  (Learning Path Designer, Sample Code Maintainer, Version Manager) enhance
  advanced scenarios without complexity overhead. Achieves 100% coverage of
  research specifications. Supports publishers like PacktPub, O'Reilly, Manning,
  and self-publishing platforms (Leanpub/KDP/Gumroad).
