        - [ ] Em-dashes: >3 per page
        - [ ] Heading depth: >4 levels
        - [ ] AI vocabulary: >10 per 1k words
        - [ ] Sentence StdDev: <3
      - [ ] Technical accuracy: Compromised in any way

      **Content Type Targets:**

      | Content Type | Quality Target | Detection Target | Strictness |
      |--------------|----------------|------------------|------------|
      | Book Chapters | ≥90 | ≤20 | HIGH |
      | Blog Posts/Articles | ≥85 | ≤30 | STANDARD |
      | Documentation | ≥80 | ≤35 | MODERATE |
      | Internal Docs/Drafts | ≥75 | ≤40 | RELAXED |

      **Publication Venue Considerations:**
      - **Target Publisher:** [PacktPub / O'Reilly / Manning / Self-Publishing / Other]
      - **Publisher AI Policy:** [Known requirements or "Unknown - verify before submission"]
      - **Compliance Status:** [Compliant / Uncertain / Non-compliant]
      - **Additional Requirements:** [List any publisher-specific tone/style requirements]

      **Risk Assessment:**
      - **AI Detection Risk:** [VERY LOW / LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH / VERY HIGH] ([Number]/100)
      - **Rationale:** [Why this risk level based on Detection Risk score and dimension analysis]
      - **Mitigation:** [If MEDIUM+ risk, list specific actions from path-to-target to reduce]

      **Reviewer Recommendations:**
      - **Technical Review:** [Ready / Not ready / Conditional]
      - **Editorial Review:** [Ready / Not ready / Conditional]
      - **Publisher Submission:** [Ready / Not ready / Conditional]

      **Next Steps:**
      [Specific actions based on readiness decision]
      - If PASS: [Proceed to technical review, etc.]
      - If CONDITIONAL PASS: [Address remaining LOW effort items, then...]
      - If FAIL: [Use iterative-humanization-optimization.md to systematically improve, focusing on path-to-target top 3 priorities]
