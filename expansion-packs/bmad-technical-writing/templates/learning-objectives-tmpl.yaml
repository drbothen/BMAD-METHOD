sections:
  - id: context
    title: Context
    instruction: |
      Specify the context for these learning objectives:
      - Chapter or section number and title
      - Topic area being covered
      - Position in overall book learning path
      - Target audience skill level
    elicit: true

    title: Learning Objectives
    instruction: |
      Define 3-5 measurable learning objectives using action verbs from Bloom's Taxonomy:

      **Remember** (recall facts): define, list, identify, name, recognize
      **Understand** (explain concepts): describe, explain, summarize, interpret
      **Apply** (use knowledge): demonstrate, implement, execute, solve, build
      **Analyze** (examine parts): compare, contrast, differentiate, debug, troubleshoot
      **Evaluate** (make judgments): assess, critique, validate, defend, justify
      **Create** (produce new): design, develop, architect, compose, construct

      For each objective:
      - Start with "By the end of this [chapter/section], you will be able to..."
      - Use specific action verbs
      - Make it measurable and observable
      - Align with content covered
      - Progress from lower to higher cognitive levels

      Example: "By the end of this chapter, you will be able to design a RESTful API with proper authentication."
    elicit: true
  - id: prerequisites
    title: Prerequisites
    instruction: |
      List what learners need to know before starting:
      - Previous chapters that must be completed
      - External knowledge assumed (programming languages, tools, concepts)
      - Skills required (command line proficiency, Git basics, etc.)
      - Environment setup needed
  - id: success_criteria
    title: Success Criteria
    instruction: |
      Define how learners can verify they've achieved the objectives:
      - Observable behaviors or deliverables
      - Self-assessment questions
      - Practical demonstrations
      - Code that should run successfully
      - Problems they can now solve

      Example: "You can successfully build and deploy a containerized web application."
  - id: assessment
    title: Assessment Approach
    instruction: |
      Describe how learning will be assessed:
      - Practice exercises aligned with objectives
      - Quiz questions covering key concepts
      - Hands-on projects that demonstrate mastery
      - Code challenges at appropriate difficulty
      - Self-check opportunities throughout chapter
