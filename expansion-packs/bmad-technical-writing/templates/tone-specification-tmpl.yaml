sections:
  - id: book_overview
    title: Book Overview & Audience
    instruction: |
      Provide context for tone decisions:

      **Book Information:**
      - Book title and topic
      - Target audience (skill level, role, experience)
      - Publisher (PacktPub, O'Reilly, Manning, Self-Publishing)
      - Book type (tutorial, reference, cookbook, comprehensive guide)
      - Estimated page count

      **Tone Context:**
      - Why tone specification matters for THIS book
      - Key challenges this tone addresses (e.g., "500-page book needs consistent voice", "multiple authors need shared guidance")
      - Audience expectations for tone (e.g., "DevOps engineers expect practical, no-nonsense guidance")

      This section sets the foundation for all tone decisions that follow.
    elicit: true

  - id: tone_personality
    title: Tone Personality (5 Key Adjectives)
    instruction: |
      Define the 5 key adjectives that characterize this book's tone:

      **For each adjective, provide:**
      1. **Adjective:** (e.g., "Encouraging", "Authoritative", "Practical")
      2. **Definition:** What this means specifically for THIS book (not generic definition)
      3. **Example:** A 2-3 sentence passage from YOUR book topic demonstrating this characteristic

      **Example Format:**

      **1. Encouraging**
      - **Definition:** Reader feels supported when facing difficult concepts, with acknowledgment that learning takes time and mistakes are normal
      - **Example:** "If Kubernetes networking seems overwhelming right now, that's completely normal. Even experienced engineers find it complex at first. We'll break it into manageable pieces, and by Chapter 8, you'll be confidently debugging network policies."

      **2. Practical**
      - **Definition:** Every concept immediately connects to real-world application with production-ready examples, not toy demos
      - **Example:** "Let's deploy this authentication service to AWS. You'll use the same Terraform configuration that handles our team's production infrastructure at scale—no shortcuts or 'this works on my laptop' examples."

      Continue this format for all 5 adjectives. Choose adjectives that meaningfully differentiate your book's voice.
    elicit: true

  - id: voice_characteristics
    title: Voice Characteristics
    instruction: |
      Define specific voice decisions for this book:

      **Formality Level:** [Select one and provide book-specific examples]
      - ☐ Level 1 (Very Casual): Frequent contractions, exclamations, very conversational
      - ☐ Level 2 (Casual/Friendly): Contractions used, friendly but structured
      - ☐ Level 3 (Professional/Conversational): Balanced contractions, professional yet warm [MOST COMMON]
      - ☐ Level 4 (Formal/Professional): Minimal contractions, structured tone
      - ☐ Level 5 (Very Formal/Academic): No contractions, scholarly tone

      **Perspective:**
      - First person: "I recommend this approach because..."
      - Second person: "You'll implement authentication in this chapter..." [MOST COMMON for technical books]
      - Third person: "Developers implement authentication by..."
      - Mixed: Specify when each is used

      **Active vs. Passive Voice:**
      - Primarily active: "We'll deploy the application..." [RECOMMENDED]
      - Primarily passive: "The application will be deployed..."
      - Mixed: Specify ratio and context for each

      **Contractions Usage:**
      - Frequent: "We'll", "You're", "It's", "Don't" (casual)
      - Moderate: Use in explanations, avoid in technical instructions [COMMON]
      - Rare: Only in direct quotes
      - Never: Always use "We will", "You are", "It is", "Do not" (formal)

      Provide 2-3 example sentences for each decision showing how it applies to YOUR book's content.
    elicit: true

  - id: formality_scale
    title: Formality Level Specification
    instruction: |
      Based on the formality level selected in Voice Characteristics, provide detailed examples:

      **Selected Formality Level:** [Restate: Level 1-5]

      **Comparison Examples Using YOUR Book's Topic:**

      Show the SAME technical concept written at different formality levels to demonstrate your choice:

      **Level 1 (Very Casual):**
      "Hey! Let's dive into [YOUR TOPIC]. This stuff is actually pretty cool once you get the hang of it. Don't worry if it seems weird at first—everyone finds it confusing!"

      **Level 2 (Casual/Friendly):**
      "Let's explore [YOUR TOPIC] together. You'll find it makes sense once you try a few examples. We'll start simple and build up to more complex scenarios."

      **Level 3 (Professional/Conversational):**
      "In this chapter, we'll examine [YOUR TOPIC]. You'll apply these concepts through practical examples. By the end, you'll understand both the theory and real-world applications."

      **Level 4 (Formal/Professional):**
      "This chapter examines [YOUR TOPIC]. Readers will apply these concepts through practical examples. The chapter covers both theoretical foundations and real-world applications."

      **Level 5 (Very Formal/Academic):**
      "This chapter presents an examination of [YOUR TOPIC]. Subsequent examples demonstrate practical applications. Coverage includes both theoretical foundations and applied implementations."

      **Your Choice:** [Mark which level matches your book's tone]

      | Concept | Term Used | Alternative Rejected | Rationale |
      |---------|-----------|---------------------|-----------|
      | Example: Container orchestration | Kubernetes or K8s? | "Container orchestrator" (too generic) | Target audience knows Kubernetes; "K8s" used after first mention |
      | [Your term 1] | [Chosen term] | [Rejected alternative] | [Why this choice fits tone] |
      | [Your term 2] | [Chosen term] | [Rejected alternative] | [Why this choice fits tone] |

      **Example Code with Comments (Use YOUR book's language/topic):**

      ```[your-language]
      # [Comment example 1 - showing your comment style]
      [code line 1]

      # [Comment example 2 - showing tone consistency]
      [code line 2]

      # [Comment example 3 - showing technical detail level]
      [code line 3]
      ```

      **Contrasting Styles to Show Your Choice:**

      **Overly verbose (if you're avoiding this):**
      ```[your-language]
      # Now we're going to create a function that will handle user authentication!
      # This is super important because we need to keep user data safe.
      def authenticate_user():
      ```

      **Your chosen style:**
      ```[your-language]
      # Authenticate user credentials against database and return session token
      def authenticate_user():
      ```

      **Too terse (if you're avoiding this):**
      ```[your-language]
      # Auth
      def authenticate_user():
      ```

  - id: excluded_tones
    title: Excluded Tones and Anti-Patterns
    instruction: |
      Define what to AVOID (equally important as what to include):

      **Excluded Tone Approaches:**

      Provide 5-8 specific tone approaches explicitly rejected for THIS book:

      **1. [Tone approach to avoid]**
      - **What it looks like:** [Example passage showing this unwanted tone]
      - **Why excluded:** [Specific reason this doesn't fit your book - audience mismatch, publisher requirements, authorial choice]
      - **Risk:** [What problem this tone would cause - e.g., "Alienates experienced readers", "Undermines technical credibility"]

      **2. [Tone approach to avoid]**
      - **What it looks like:** [Example passage]
      - **Why excluded:** [Specific reason]
      - **Risk:** [Potential problem]

      [Continue for 5-8 exclusions]

      **Common Examples of Excluded Tones:**

      - ❌ **Overly playful/childish:** "Wheee! Let's make our code go zoom zoom with super speedy algorithms!" (Why: Undermines professional audience)

      - ❌ **Condescending:** "Even a beginner should understand this obvious concept. If you don't get it, go back to Chapter 1." (Why: Alienates learners)

      - ❌ **Aggressive/preachy:** "You're doing it WRONG if you don't use X framework! Anyone using Y is incompetent." (Why: Discourages exploration, damages credibility)

      - ❌ **Overly academic:** "Herein we shall explicate the algorithmic paradigm pursuant to theoretical foundations..." (Why: Too formal for practitioner audience)

      - ❌ **Salesy/marketing hype:** "This AMAZING, REVOLUTIONARY technique will CHANGE YOUR LIFE and make you a 10x developer!" (Why: Reduces technical credibility)

      - ❌ **Apologetic/uncertain:** "I'm not sure if this is the best way, but maybe try this approach if you want..." (Why: Undermines author authority)

      Customize these examples for YOUR book's specific context and audience.

      **Anti-Patterns to Monitor:**

      - Tone inconsistency (formal introduction, then suddenly casual mid-chapter)
      - Formality level drift (starting Level 3, drifting to Level 1 by Chapter 10)
      - Excessive metaphors (every concept becomes elaborate analogy)
      - Exclamation point overuse (or complete absence if encouraging tone intended)
      - Inconsistent contraction usage (mixing "we'll" and "we will" randomly)
      - Pronoun perspective shifts (switching between "you", "we", "one" without pattern)

      **Validation Questions:**
      - Have you identified tone approaches that would genuinely harm YOUR specific book? [Yes/No]
      - Are exclusions specific enough to guide editing decisions? [Yes/No]
      - Do anti-patterns address realistic drift risks for YOUR writing style? [Yes/No]

      These exclusions help editors catch tone violations during copy editing.
