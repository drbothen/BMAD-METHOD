sections:
  - id: metadata
    title: Section Metadata
    instruction: |
      Basic information:
      - Section ID (e.g., "section-3.2" for chapter 3, section 2)
      - Section title (descriptive, clear)
      - Chapter number and chapter title
      - Position in chapter (e.g., "2 of 8")
      - Estimated pages (2-5 pages typical)
      - Story points equivalent (Small=3, Medium=5, Large=8)
  - id: learning_objective
    title: Learning Objective
    instruction: |
      What this section teaches (1-2 objectives max):
      - Use action verbs from Bloom's Taxonomy (implement, explain, demonstrate, apply)
      - Be specific and measurable
      - Focus on single concept or skill
      - Examples:
        * "Implement basic list operations in Python"
        * "Explain memory management in dictionary structures"
        * "Demonstrate error handling in file operations"

      Keep focused - if you have 3+ objectives, section is too large.
  - id: prerequisites
    title: Prerequisites
    instruction: |
      What reader needs before this section:
      - Previous sections that must be completed (by section ID)
      - Concepts from earlier chapters assumed
      - Code from previous sections that will be extended
      - Tools or setup required (if new to this section)
  - id: content_plan
    title: Content Plan
    instruction: |
      Concepts to explain in this section:
      - Main concept/topic (1-2 paragraphs description)
      - Key points to cover (bullet list, 3-5 points)
      - Theory/background needed (minimal, just enough)
      - Tutorial approach (step-by-step? example-driven? problem-solving?)
      - Estimated breakdown:
        * Concept explanation: X pages
        * Tutorial/walkthrough: X pages
        * Practice/exercises: X pages
  - id: code_examples
    title: Code Examples Needed
    instruction: |
      Code examples for this section:
      - Example 1: [filename] - [purpose] - [complexity: simple/medium/complex]
      - Example 2: [filename] - [purpose] - [complexity]
      - (continue as needed, typically 1-3 examples per section)

      For each example specify:
      - What it demonstrates
      - Input and expected output
      - Testing approach
      - Common mistakes to highlight
  - id: success_criteria
    title: Success Criteria
    instruction: |
      This section is "DONE" when:
      - [ ] Learning objective(s) clearly explained
      - [ ] All code examples developed and tested
      - [ ] Tutorial walkthrough complete with explanations
      - [ ] Common mistakes and troubleshooting covered
      - [ ] Section length 2-5 pages (not too short, not too long)
      - [ ] Transitions to next section clear
      - [ ] Technical reviewer approved section accuracy
      - [ ] No outstanding technical issues

      Add section-specific criteria as needed (e.g., "Performance example runs in <100ms")
  - id: dependencies
    title: Dependencies
    instruction: |
      Dependencies on other sections:
      - Must complete before starting: [list section IDs]
      - Can develop in parallel with: [list section IDs]
      - Blocks these sections: [list section IDs that need this one]

      Example:
      - Must complete: section-3.1 (introduces list basics)
      - Can parallel: section-3.4 (different topic)
      - Blocks: section-3.3 (extends this section's code)
  - id: notes
    title: Development Notes
    instruction: |
      Additional guidance for section development:
      - Key resources or references
      - Known complexity areas
      - Reader perspective considerations
      - Connection to real-world use cases
      - Special attention areas (security, performance, etc.)
