## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-21

### ðŸš¨ BREAKING CHANGES

#### Directory Structure Refactor: `docs/` â†’ `manuscript/`

**Changed**: All book content directories renamed from `docs/` to `manuscript/` for semantic clarity and industry alignment.

**Migration Required**: Existing v1.x projects must rename their `docs/` directory to `manuscript/`.

**Affected Paths**:
- `docs/planning/` â†’ `manuscript/planning/`
- `docs/sections/` â†’ `manuscript/sections/`
- `docs/chapters/` â†’ `manuscript/chapters/`
- `docs/outlines/` â†’ `manuscript/outlines/`
- `docs/reviews/` â†’ `manuscript/reviews/`

**Rationale**:
- âœ… Aligns with publishing industry terminology ("manuscript submission")
- âœ… Provides semantic clarity (manuscript content vs project documentation)
- âœ… Enables clear separation: `manuscript/` for book content, `docs/` for project meta-docs
- âœ… Reduces confusion for GitHub contributors

**Migration Guide**: See [docs/MIGRATION-v2.md](docs/MIGRATION-v2.md) for complete migration instructions.

**Architectural Decision**: See [docs/decisions/ADR-001-manuscript-directory.md](docs/decisions/ADR-001-manuscript-directory.md) for full rationale.
