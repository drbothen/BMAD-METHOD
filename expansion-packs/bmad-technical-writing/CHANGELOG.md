## [Unreleased]

### Changed

**PacktPub Formatting Workflow - v6 Script Update**

- Updated all references from `apply-packt-styles-v5.py` to `apply-packt-styles-v6.py`
- Enhanced script now includes:
  - Table caption detection and styling (format: `Table X.Y: Description`)
  - Figure caption detection and styling (embedded images + keywords)
  - Automatic table cell styling: "Table Column Heading [PACKT]" / "Table Column Content [PACKT]"
  - Both table and figure captions styled as "Figure Caption [PACKT]" (PacktPub standard)

**Updated Files**:
- `tasks/format-for-packtpub.md` - Script reference updated to v6, added caption placement section (2.3)
- `README.md` - Script reference and usage examples updated to v6
- `workflows/packtpub-submission-workflow.yaml` - Added caption placement requirements and common pitfalls

### Added

**Caption Placement Documentation**

- `data/packtpub-author-bundle/CAPTION-PLACEMENT-GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive 200+ line guide covering:
  - **CRITICAL RULE**: Table captions BEFORE tables, figure captions AFTER images
  - Common mistakes with examples
  - Numbering conventions (`Table X.Y:` / `Figure X.Y:`)
  - Alt text vs caption distinction
  - Why placement matters for reader comprehension
  - Integration with validation scripts

**Enhanced Task Documentation**

- Added section 2.3 "Caption Placement Validation" to `tasks/format-for-packtpub.md`
- Updated Python script logic documentation (steps 7-8) for caption and table styling
- Added CAPTION-PLACEMENT-GUIDE.md to related files documentation

**Workflow Enhancements**

- Updated `packtpub-submission-workflow.yaml`:
  - Quality gates now include caption placement validation
  - Format requirements specify table/figure caption formats
  - Common pitfalls warn about incorrect caption placement

### Technical Details

**Script Changes (v5 â†’ v6)**:
- New function: `is_figure_caption()` - Detects both table and figure captions
- New function: `has_image()` - Checks for embedded images in paragraphs
- Table caption regex: `r'^Table\s+\d+\.\d+:'`
- Automatic table cell styling based on row position (first row = headers)
- **NEW**: Automatic removal of Pandoc alt text paragraphs for cleaner output
- **FIXED**: 2-paragraph lookback for figure caption detection (handles Pandoc 3-para structure)
- **SIMPLIFIED**: After alt text removal, only need 1-paragraph lookback

**Testing** (Comprehensive):
- âœ… 5 tables tested with captions (139 cells: 25 headers + 114 content)
- âœ… 4 figures tested with embedded images (all captions detected)
- âœ… Alt text removal: 4 paragraphs removed (130 â†’ 126 total)
- âœ… All captions correctly positioned and styled (9/9 = 100%)
- âœ… Code blocks: 2/2 correctly styled
- âœ… Lists: 34/34 items correctly styled
- âœ… Pre-conversion validation: PASS (0 errors, warnings only)
- âœ… Post-conversion verification: PASS (0 errors)
- âœ… **Overall compliance: 126/126 paragraphs (100%)**

## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-21

### ðŸš¨ BREAKING CHANGES

#### Directory Structure Refactor: `docs/` â†’ `manuscript/`

**Changed**: All book content directories renamed from `docs/` to `manuscript/` for semantic clarity and industry alignment.

**Migration Required**: Existing v1.x projects must rename their `docs/` directory to `manuscript/`.

**Affected Paths**:

- `docs/planning/` â†’ `manuscript/planning/`
- `docs/sections/` â†’ `manuscript/sections/`
- `docs/chapters/` â†’ `manuscript/chapters/`
- `docs/outlines/` â†’ `manuscript/outlines/`
- `docs/reviews/` â†’ `manuscript/reviews/`

**Rationale**:

- âœ… Aligns with publishing industry terminology ("manuscript submission")
- âœ… Provides semantic clarity (manuscript content vs project documentation)
- âœ… Enables clear separation: `manuscript/` for book content, `docs/` for project meta-docs
- âœ… Reduces confusion for GitHub contributors

**Migration Guide**: See [docs/MIGRATION-v2.md](docs/MIGRATION-v2.md) for complete migration instructions.

**Architectural Decision**: See [docs/decisions/ADR-001-manuscript-directory.md](docs/decisions/ADR-001-manuscript-directory.md) for full rationale.
