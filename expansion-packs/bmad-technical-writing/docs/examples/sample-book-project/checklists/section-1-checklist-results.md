### 2. Technical Correctness ✅

- [ ] ✅ Concepts explained accurately
- [ ] ✅ No misleading simplifications
- [ ] ✅ Edge cases mentioned where important
- [ ] ✅ Limitations or caveats stated clearly

**Notes**: Zero-based indexing, negative indices, and slicing all explained correctly.

### 3. Terminology ✅

- [ ] ✅ Technical terms used correctly
- [ ] ✅ Terms defined on first use
- [ ] ✅ Consistent terminology throughout
- [ ] ✅ No jargon without explanation

**Notes**: "Index," "element," "slice," and "mutable" all used correctly.

### 4. Examples Quality ✅

- [ ] ✅ Examples demonstrate the concept clearly
- [ ] ✅ Examples are realistic and practical
- [ ] ✅ Progressive complexity (simple → advanced)

**Notes**: Examples progress from basic (`[1,2,3]`) to practical (student scores).

### 5. Code Comments ✅

- [ ] ✅ Code has helpful comments where needed
- [ ] ✅ Comments are accurate
- [ ] ✅ Complex code is explained

### 6. Error Handling ✅

- [ ] ✅ Common errors mentioned (e.g., IndexError)
- [ ] ✅ Error messages explained
- [ ] ✅ How to avoid errors shown
- [ ] ✅ Try/except used appropriately in examples

**Notes**: IndexError prominently featured in "Common Pitfalls" section.

### 7. Testing ✅

- [ ] ✅ Code examples have accompanying tests
- [ ] ✅ All tests pass
- [ ] ✅ Tests cover main use cases
- [ ] ✅ Test file follows naming convention

**Notes**: `test_list_basics.py` has 26 tests covering all examples.

### 8. Compatibility ✅

**Notes**: Slicing for copying (`[:]`) mentioned as efficient approach.

## Summary

**Total Items**: 10
**Passed**: ✅ 10
**Failed**: ❌ 0
**Warnings**: ⚠️ 0

## Overall Assessment

✅ **PASS** - Section meets all technical accuracy criteria.

## Follow-up Actions

1. Minor: Add edge case note for negative indexing out of bounds
2. Minor: Standardize "list" capitalization
3. Proceed to finalization

## Approval
