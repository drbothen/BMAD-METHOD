# Sample Book Project: Python Essentials - Chapter 3

## What This Demonstrates

Complete section-driven development workflow for technical book writing:
1. Chapter outline creation
2. Section planning (breaking chapter into sections)
3. Section development (3 complete sections)
4. Chapter assembly (merge + polish)
5. All quality gates and reviews

## Book Context

**Book**: Python Essentials: Data Structures and Algorithms
**Target Audience**: Beginner programmers with basic Python knowledge
**Chapter**: 3 - Working with Lists and Tuples
**Sections**: 3 fully developed (plus 3 planned but not developed)

## How to Use This Sample

1. **Study the workflow**: Read WALKTHROUGH.md to see step-by-step creation
2. **Examine artifacts**: See all intermediate files (drafts, reviews, etc.)
3. **Review workflows**: See which agent/task was used at each step
4. **Use as template**: Copy structure for your own book project

## Directory Structure

- `manuscript/` - All written content (outlines, sections, chapters)
  - `outlines/` - Chapter outline documents
  - `sections/chapter-3/` - Section planning, drafts, reviews, finals
  - `chapters/` - Assembled chapter versions
- `code/` - All code examples with tests
  - `chapter-3/section-{n}/` - Code examples per section
- `reviews/` - Technical review reports and feedback
- `checklists/` - Quality gate results

## Workflows Demonstrated

✅ Section Planning Workflow (chapter-3-section-list.md)
✅ Section Development Workflow (3 sections, complete loop)
✅ Chapter Assembly Workflow (integrated → reviewed → final)

## Sprint 7 Features Shown

✅ tasks/write-section-draft.md (section writing)
✅ tasks/execute-checklist.md (quality gates)
✅ tasks/merge-sections.md (chapter assembly)
✅ tasks/enhance-transitions.md (narrative flow)
✅ tasks/validate-learning-flow.md (instructional design review)

## Quick Start

1. Read WALKTHROUGH.md for guided tour
2. Explore manuscript/sections/chapter-3/ to see section workflow
3. See code/chapter-3/ for tested code examples
4. Review manuscript/chapters/chapter-3-final.md for end result

## Sample Sections Developed

**Section 3.1: List Basics (Creating and Accessing Lists)**
- Demonstrates: Creating lists, indexing, slicing
- Code: `code/chapter-3/section-1/`
- Pages: 3-4

**Section 3.2: List Operations (Modify, Add, Remove)**
- Demonstrates: Mutating lists, append, insert, remove, pop
- Code: `code/chapter-3/section-2/`
- Pages: 3-4

**Section 3.3: Tuples and Immutability**
- Demonstrates: Tuples vs lists, when to use each
- Code: `code/chapter-3/section-3/`
- Pages: 3-4

## Sections Planned (Not Developed)

These sections are planned in the section-list but not developed in this sample:
- Section 3.4: List Comprehensions
- Section 3.5: Sorting and Searching
- Section 3.6: Practical Applications

## Estimated Time to Create

**Total**: 12-16 hours

**Breakdown**:
- Planning (outlines, section plans): 2-3 hours
- Section 1 development: 3-4 hours
- Section 2 development: 3-4 hours
- Section 3 development: 3-4 hours
- Chapter assembly: 2-3 hours

## Key Takeaways

1. **Section-driven workflow enables incremental progress** - Each section is 3-6 hours of manageable work
2. **Quality gates catch issues early** - Reviews and checklists at section level prevent chapter-level rework
3. **Sprint 7 tasks make workflow executable** - Clear tasks for each workflow step
4. **Code examples are first-class** - Tested, working code integrated into narrative
5. **Multiple review layers ensure quality** - Section reviews, technical reviews, copy editing

## How to Adapt for Your Book

- **Your topic**: Replace Python content with your domain
- **More sections**: Follow same pattern for sections 4-6 (or more)
- **Less sections**: 3 sections works for shorter chapters
- **Traditional workflow**: For simple chapters, skip section-driven approach
- **Publisher requirements**: Add their templates and review processes
