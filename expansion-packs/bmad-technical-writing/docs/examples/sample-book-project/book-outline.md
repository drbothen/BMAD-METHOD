## Code Repository Structure

All code examples will be organized by chapter and section:

```
code/
├── chapter-1/
├── chapter-2/
├── chapter-3/
│   ├── section-1/  # List basics
│   ├── section-2/  # List operations

## Notes for Sample Project

This book outline was created to provide context for **Chapter 3: Working with Lists and Tuples**, which is fully developed in the sample project located in `expansion-packs/bmad-technical-writing/docs/examples/sample-book-project/`.

The sample demonstrates:
- Complete section-driven workflow for one chapter
- 3 sections fully developed (3.1, 3.2, 3.3)
- All code examples tested and working
- Full workflow artifacts (drafts, reviews, checklists)
- Chapter assembly from sections to final

See `WALKTHROUGH.md` for step-by-step guide on how this sample was created.
