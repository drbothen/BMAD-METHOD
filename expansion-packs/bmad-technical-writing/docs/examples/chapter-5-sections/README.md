# Chapter 5 Test Sections

This directory contains sample chapter sections for testing the `merge-sections.md` and `enhance-transitions.md` tasks.

## Test Scenario

**Chapter:** Chapter 5: Database Operations
**Sections:** 6 completed sections
**Purpose:** Validate chapter assembly workflow tasks

## Section Files

1. `section-5.1-final.md` - Connecting to PostgreSQL
2. `section-5.2-final.md` - Creating Tables with SQLAlchemy
3. `section-5.3-final.md` - CRUD Operations
4. `section-5.4-final.md` - Query Filtering
5. `section-5.5-final.md` - Joins and Relationships
6. `section-5.6-final.md` - Transactions and Error Handling

## Testing merge-sections.md

**Expected Behavior:**
- All 6 sections merged in correct order
- Chapter introduction added (learning objectives, prerequisites)
- Chapter summary added (key concepts, skills developed)
- Heading hierarchy standardized (H1 chapter, H2 sections, H3 subsections)
- Code formatting consistent
- All content preserved exactly

**Output:** `chapter-5-integrated.md`

## Testing enhance-transitions.md

**Test Planted Abrupt Transitions:**

After merging, remove bridging text between:
- Section 5.3 → 5.4 (CRUD to Filtering)
- Section 5.4 → 5.5 (Filtering to Joins)
- Section 5.5 → 5.6 (Joins to Transactions)

**Expected Enhancements:**
- Bridging paragraphs added between sections
- Smooth narrative flow established
- Cross-references added where appropriate
- Varied transition patterns applied

## Success Criteria

✓ Merged chapter feels like single narrative, not stitched sections
✓ Transitions are natural and maintain momentum
✓ No jarring shifts in tone or difficulty
✓ Prerequisites referenced appropriately
✓ Ready for instructional designer validation
