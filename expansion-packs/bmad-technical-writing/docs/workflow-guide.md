## Development Workflows

### Chapter Development Workflow (v2.0 - Section-Driven)

**ID**: `chapter-development-workflow`
**Type**: chapter-writing
**Version**: 2.0

#### Purpose

Complete chapter creation from outline to publisher-ready manuscript. v2.0 orchestrates **section-driven development** (section-planning → section-development → chapter-assembly). Can also be used for traditional full-chapter writing. Emphasizes learning objectives, hands-on tutorials, tested code examples, and professional quality standards.

#### When to Use Section-Driven Approach

- Chapters 15+ pages (too large for single sitting)
- Want incremental progress tracking ("5 of 8 sections complete")
- Need parallel development (multiple sections in progress)
- Want to review work-in-progress before full chapter done
- Prefer story-driven iterative approach (BMad analog)

#### When to Use Traditional Approach

- Short chapters (<10-12 pages)
- Simple reference sections
- Author prefers writing full chapter at once
- Chapter already partially written

#### Inputs Required

- `book-outline.md` - Approved book outline

#### Outputs Produced (Section-Driven)

- `chapter-outline.md` - Detailed chapter outline
- `section-list.md` - List of all section plans
- `section-{n}-final.md` - Each completed section
- `chapter-integrated.md` - Merged chapter
- `chapter-final.md` - Publisher-ready chapter

#### Agents Involved (Section-Driven Sequence)

1. **tutorial-architect** - Creates chapter outline
2. **tutorial-architect** → **section-planning-workflow** - Plans 5-8 sections
3. **tutorial-architect** → **section-development-workflow** - Develops each section
4. **tutorial-architect** → **chapter-assembly-workflow** - Assembles chapter
5. **tutorial-architect** - Final validation

#### Estimated Time

**Section-Driven Approach:**
- Create outline: 2-4 hours
- Plan sections: 6-11 hours
- Develop sections: 33-84 hours (can be parallel)
- Assemble chapter: 13-24 hours
- **Total**: 54-123 hours per chapter (parallel development possible)

**Traditional Approach:**
- Create outline: 2-4 hours
- Develop code: 4-8 hours
- Write draft: 12-20 hours
- Technical review: 3-5 hours
- Revision: 4-8 hours

## Best Practices

### Workflow Selection

- **Use section-driven** for chapters 15+ pages, parallel development, incremental progress tracking
- **Use traditional** for short chapters, solo authors, simple reference content
- **Use brownfield workflows** when updating existing content (maintain consistency)
- **Start with planning** - never skip book planning workflow for new books

### Time Management

- Section-driven has higher total time but enables parallel work
- Traditional is faster for solo authors on short chapters
- Time estimates include quality gates - don't skip them
- Buffer time for revisions (feedback always reveals issues)

### Quality Gates

- Every workflow has quality gates - they prevent rework
- Address critical issues before proceeding (cheaper to fix early)
- Run checklists at specified points (they catch common errors)
- Technical review before editorial polish (preserve accuracy)

### Agent Coordination

- Follow workflow sequence - agents depend on prior outputs
- Save outputs to specified locations (other agents need them)
- Use handoff prompts to communicate context between agents
- Parallel development possible in section-driven (check dependencies)

### Iteration

- Workflows are iterative - expect revision cycles
- Section review catches issues early (before full chapter assembly)
- Beta readers provide valuable feedback - use incorporate-feedback workflow
- Publishers may request changes - brownfield workflows handle this
