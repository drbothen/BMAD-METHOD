### Switch to Tutorial Architect

Now activate the Tutorial Architect for hands-on section writing:

**In IDE**:
```
/bmad-tw:tutorial-architect
```

---

## Step 3: Write Your First Section

### Goal
Write one complete section (Section 1.2: Introduction to Lists) with code examples and tutorial content.

### Activate Code Curator

First, we need working code examples. Activate Code Curator:

**In IDE**:
```
/bmad-tw:code-curator
```

### Create Code Examples

**Command**:
```
*create-code-example
```

**Specify**:
- Section: 1.2 - Introduction to Lists
- Example title: "Building a Task List Application"
- Concepts to demonstrate: List creation, append, remove, indexing

**Code Curator Creates**:

`examples/chapter-01/task_list.py`:
```python
# Task List Application - Introduction to Lists

def main():
    """Demonstrate basic list operations through a task list app."""

    # Create an empty list
    tasks = []
    print(f"Starting tasks: {tasks}")

    # Add tasks using append
    tasks.append("Write chapter outline")
    tasks.append("Create code examples")
    tasks.append("Review draft")
    print(f"After adding tasks: {tasks}")

    # Access tasks by index
    first_task = tasks[0]
    print(f"First task: {first_task}")

    # Add task at specific position
    tasks.insert(1, "Write section 1")
    print(f"After inserting: {tasks}")

    # Remove completed task
    tasks.remove("Write chapter outline")
    print(f"After completing first task: {tasks}")

    # Check remaining tasks
    print(f"Total remaining tasks: {len(tasks)}")

    # Iterate through tasks
    print("\nRemaining tasks:")
    for i, task in enumerate(tasks, 1):
        print(f"{i}. {task}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

`examples/chapter-01/test_task_list.py`:
```python
import pytest
from task_list import main

def test_list_creation():
    """Test that lists can be created and modified."""
    tasks = []
    assert tasks == []

    tasks.append("test task")
    assert len(tasks) == 1
    assert tasks[0] == "test task"

def test_list_operations():
    """Test insert and remove operations."""
    tasks = ["first", "second"]
    tasks.insert(1, "middle")
    assert tasks == ["first", "middle", "second"]

    tasks.remove("middle")
    assert tasks == ["first", "second"]
```

**Command**:
```
*test-code-examples
```

Code Curator runs tests:
```
pytest examples/chapter-01/test_task_list.py -v
================================ test session starts ================================
examples/chapter-01/test_task_list.py::test_list_creation PASSED                [ 50%]
examples/chapter-01/test_task_list.py::test_list_operations PASSED              [100%]
================================ 2 passed in 0.03s ==================================
✅ All tests passed
```

### Write Section Content

**Reactivate Tutorial Architect**, command:
```
*create-tutorial
```

**Specify**:
- Section: 1.2 - Introduction to Lists
- Use code example: `task_list.py`
- Include: explanation, tutorial, troubleshooting

**Tutorial Architect Writes**:

`sections/section-1.2-introduction-to-lists.md`:

```markdown
# Section 1.2: Introduction to Lists

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this section, you'll be able to:
- Create lists in Python
- Add items to lists using `append()` and `insert()`
- Remove items from lists
- Access list items by index
- Iterate through lists

**Prerequisites**: Basic Python syntax, understanding of variables

**Estimated Time**: 20-30 minutes

---

## What are Lists?

Lists are Python's most versatile data structure. Think of a list as a container that holds multiple items in a specific order, like a to-do list or a shopping list.

**Key characteristics**:
- **Ordered** - Items maintain their position
- **Mutable** - You can add, remove, or change items
- **Allow duplicates** - The same item can appear multiple times
- **Dynamic size** - Lists grow and shrink automatically

---

## Creating Lists

Lists are created using square brackets `[]`:

```python
# Empty list
tasks = []

# List with initial items
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
mixed = [1, "hello", 3.14, True]  # Lists can hold different types
```

---

## Hands-On Tutorial: Building a Task List

Let's build a simple task list application to learn list operations.

### Step 1: Create an Empty List

```python
tasks = []
print(f"Starting tasks: {tasks}")
# Output: Starting tasks: []
```

### Step 2: Add Tasks with append()

The `append()` method adds an item to the end of the list:

```python
tasks.append("Write chapter outline")
tasks.append("Create code examples")
tasks.append("Review draft")
print(f"After adding tasks: {tasks}")
# Output: After adding tasks: ['Write chapter outline', 'Create code examples', 'Review draft']
```

### Step 3: Access Items by Index

Lists use zero-based indexing. The first item is at index 0:

```python
first_task = tasks[0]
print(f"First task: {first_task}")
# Output: First task: Write chapter outline
```

### Step 4: Insert Tasks at Specific Position

Use `insert(position, item)` to add an item at a specific index:

```python
tasks.insert(1, "Write section 1")
print(f"After inserting: {tasks}")
# Output: After inserting: ['Write chapter outline', 'Write section 1', 'Create code examples', 'Review draft']
```

### Step 5: Remove Completed Tasks

Use `remove(item)` to delete an item by value:

```python
tasks.remove("Write chapter outline")
print(f"After completing first task: {tasks}")
# Output: After completing first task: ['Write section 1', 'Create code examples', 'Review draft']
```

### Step 6: Iterate Through Tasks

Loop through list items with a for loop:

```python
print("\nRemaining tasks:")
for i, task in enumerate(tasks, 1):
    print(f"{i}. {task}")

# Output:
# Remaining tasks:
# 1. Write section 1
# 2. Create code examples
# 3. Review draft
```

---

## Expected Output

When you run the complete example:

```
python examples/chapter-01/task_list.py
```

You should see:

```
Starting tasks: []
After adding tasks: ['Write chapter outline', 'Create code examples', 'Review draft']
First task: Write chapter outline
After inserting: ['Write chapter outline', 'Write section 1', 'Create code examples', 'Review draft']
After completing first task: ['Write section 1', 'Create code examples', 'Review draft']
Total remaining tasks: 3

Remaining tasks:
1. Write section 1
2. Create code examples
3. Review draft
```

---

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Issue: IndexError: list index out of range

**Cause**: Trying to access an index that doesn't exist

```python
tasks = ["task 1", "task 2"]
print(tasks[5])  # Error! Only indices 0 and 1 exist
```

**Solution**: Check list length before accessing:
```python
if len(tasks) > 5:
    print(tasks[5])
else:
    print("Index out of range")
```

### Issue: ValueError: list.remove(x): x not in list

**Cause**: Trying to remove an item that doesn't exist

**Solution**: Check if item exists first:
```python
if "task" in tasks:
    tasks.remove("task")
```

---

## Key Takeaways

- Lists are created with square brackets: `[]`
- `append(item)` adds to the end
- `insert(index, item)` adds at a specific position
- `remove(item)` deletes the first occurrence
- Lists use zero-based indexing: `tasks[0]` is the first item
- `len(list)` returns the number of items

---

## Practice Exercise

Create a shopping list application that:
1. Creates an empty list
2. Adds 5 items
3. Removes 1 item
4. Prints the final list

Try it yourself before checking the solution!

**Solution**:
```python
shopping = []
shopping.append("apples")
shopping.append("bread")
shopping.append("milk")
shopping.append("eggs")
shopping.append("cheese")
shopping.remove("milk")
print(f"Shopping list: {shopping}")
```

---

**Next**: Section 1.3 - List Methods and Iteration
```

**Output**: Complete section (~3 pages) with tutorial, code, and exercises.
