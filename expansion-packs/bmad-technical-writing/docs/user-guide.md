#### 1. Planning Phase
**Goal**: Design the learning experience and book structure

- Define target audience and prerequisites
- Create learning objectives aligned with outcomes
- Design book outline with chapter progression
- Map prerequisite dependencies between chapters
- Validate pedagogical structure

**Key Deliverables**: Book proposal, book outline, learning objectives

**Agents Involved**: Instructional Designer, Tutorial Architect, Book Publisher

#### 2. Drafting Phase
**Goal**: Create chapter content with code examples and tutorials

- Design chapter outline with section breakdown
- Write section content (2-5 pages per section)
- Create working code examples
- Develop practice exercises
- Document expected outcomes and troubleshooting

**Key Deliverables**: Chapter drafts, code examples, exercise sets

**Agents Involved**: Tutorial Architect, Code Curator, Exercise Creator

#### 3. Review Phase
**Goal**: Ensure technical accuracy, security, and quality

- Verify technical correctness of all content
- Audit code examples for security vulnerabilities
- Validate best practices and patterns
- Check performance considerations
- Test cross-platform compatibility

**Key Deliverables**: Technical review report, revision notes

**Agents Involved**: Technical Reviewer, Code Curator

#### 4. Editing Phase

- Improve clarity and readability
- Ensure consistent style and tone
- Verify publisher formatting requirements
- Check accessibility standards
- Validate cross-references and citations

**Key Deliverables**: Polished manuscript, style corrections

**Agents Involved**: Technical Editor

#### 5. Publishing Phase
**Goal**: Prepare and submit manuscript to publisher

- Package manuscript per publisher specifications
- Create supplementary materials (preface, appendix, index, glossary)
- Prepare code repositories
- Generate submission materials
- Handle MEAP/beta releases (Manning/Leanpub)

**Key Deliverables**: Submission package, code repository, supplementary materials

**Agents Involved**: Book Publisher, API Documenter, Screenshot Specialist

### Agent System

Agents are specialized AI personas that handle specific aspects of book authoring. Each agent has:

- **Defined role and expertise** - Clear responsibilities and domain knowledge
- **Commands** - Specific actions the agent can perform
- **Dependencies** - Templates, tasks, and checklists the agent uses
- **Activation instructions** - How the agent initializes and operates

**Agent Categories**:

1. **Core Agents (10)** - Required for basic book authoring
   - Instructional Designer, Tutorial Architect, Code Curator
   - Technical Reviewer, Technical Editor, Book Publisher
   - API Documenter, Screenshot Specialist, Exercise Creator
   - Book Analyst (brownfield)

2. **Optional Agents (3)** - For advanced scenarios
   - Learning Path Designer (complex prerequisite mapping)
   - Sample Code Maintainer (extensive code repository management)
   - Version Manager (multi-version compatibility matrices)

**How Agents Work**:
- Agents are activated using slash commands (e.g., `/bmad-tw:instructional-designer`)
- Once activated, an agent loads its persona and presents available commands
- Users select commands to execute specific tasks
- Agents can call other agents via workflow orchestration
- Agents stay in character until explicitly told to exit

**Agent Collaboration**:
Agents collaborate through workflows. For example, in section-development-workflow:
1. Tutorial Architect outlines the section
2. Code Curator creates code examples
3. Tutorial Architect writes tutorial content using the code
4. Technical Reviewer verifies accuracy
5. Tutorial Architect incorporates feedback

### Workflow Orchestration

Workflows are structured sequences that coordinate multiple agents to accomplish complex book authoring tasks.

**Workflow Structure** (YAML):
```yaml
workflow:
  name: section-development-workflow
  agents:
    primary: tutorial-architect
    supporting: [code-curator, technical-reviewer]
  steps:
    - agent: tutorial-architect
      task: outline-section
    - agent: code-curator
      task: create-code-examples
    - agent: tutorial-architect
      task: write-tutorial-content
    - agent: technical-reviewer
      task: review-section
```

**Workflow Types**:

1. **Planning Workflows** - Structure and design
   - `book-planning-workflow` - Complete book planning from concept to outline

2. **Development Workflows** - Content creation
   - `section-planning-workflow` - Break chapter into sections
   - `section-development-workflow` - Write individual sections
   - `chapter-assembly-workflow` - Merge sections into complete chapter
   - `chapter-development-workflow` - Complete chapter creation
   - `tutorial-creation-workflow` - Hands-on tutorial development
   - `code-example-workflow` - Code example creation and testing

3. **Review Workflows** - Quality assurance
   - `technical-review-workflow` - Technical accuracy verification
   - `incorporate-review-feedback-workflow` - Apply reviewer feedback

4. **Publishing Workflows** - Submission preparation
   - `packtpub-submission-workflow` - PacktPub formatting and submission
   - `oreilly-submission-workflow` - O'Reilly standards compliance
   - `manning-meap-workflow` - Manning MEAP release preparation
   - `self-publishing-workflow` - Leanpub/KDP/Gumroad preparation

5. **Brownfield Workflows** - Existing book updates
   - `book-edition-update-workflow` - 2nd/3rd edition revisions
   - `add-chapter-to-existing-book-workflow` - Add chapters to existing books

**How Workflows Execute**:
1. User activates primary agent
2. User triggers workflow command
3. Agent executes workflow steps sequentially
4. Each step may involve tasks, templates, and checklists
5. Agent may call supporting agents for specific steps
6. Workflow completes with deliverable output

### Section-Driven Development

Section-driven development is the recommended approach for writing technical book chapters. It breaks chapters into small, manageable sections (2-5 pages each) that can be developed independently.

**Why Section-Driven?**

- **Manageable scope** - Small sections are easier to write and review
- **Parallel development** - Multiple sections can be developed simultaneously
- **Incremental progress** - Each section completion is a milestone
- **Quality focus** - Easier to maintain quality in small chunks
- **Flexibility** - Sections can be reordered or replaced without major rewrites

**Section-Driven Workflow**:

1. **Plan**: Instructional Designer creates chapter outline, breaks into 6-8 sections
2. **Develop**: Tutorial Architect writes each section individually
3. **Review**: Technical Reviewer validates each section
4. **Assemble**: Technical Editor merges sections into cohesive chapter
5. **Publish**: Book Publisher prepares final chapter for submission

**Section Structure**:
- **Introduction** (0.5-1 page) - What you'll learn, prerequisites
- **Concept Explanation** (1-2 pages) - Theory and context
- **Hands-On Tutorial** (1-2 pages) - Step-by-step implementation
- **Troubleshooting** (0.5-1 page) - Common issues and solutions
- **Summary** (0.5 page) - Key takeaways, next steps

**Example Section Breakdown** (Chapter 3: Lists and Tuples):
- Section 3.1: Introduction to Lists (3 pages)
- Section 3.2: List Operations and Methods (4 pages)
- Section 3.3: List Comprehensions (3 pages)
- Section 3.4: Introduction to Tuples (3 pages)
- Section 3.5: When to Use Lists vs Tuples (2 pages)
- Section 3.6: Advanced List Techniques (4 pages)

### Greenfield vs Brownfield Approaches

**Greenfield** = New book written from scratch

**Use When**:
- Starting a completely new book project
- No existing content to work with
- Clean slate for structure and design

**Agents Used**:
- Instructional Designer (book planning)
- Tutorial Architect (content creation)
- Code Curator (code examples)
- Technical Reviewer (accuracy)
- Technical Editor (polish)
- Book Publisher (submission)
- Plus specialists (API Documenter, Screenshot Specialist, Exercise Creator)

**Workflows**:
- book-planning-workflow
- chapter-development-workflow
- section-development-workflow
- Publisher-specific submission workflows

---

**Brownfield** = Existing book updates, revisions, additions

**Use When**:
- Writing 2nd or 3rd edition
- Updating for new technology version (Python 3.10 → 3.12)
- Adding chapters to existing book
- Incorporating reviewer feedback
- Migrating to new publisher

**Agents Used**:
- Book Analyst (analyze existing content, plan revisions)
- Plus all greenfield agents for new/updated content

**Workflows**:
- book-edition-update-workflow
- add-chapter-to-existing-book-workflow
- incorporate-review-feedback-workflow

**Brownfield Process**:
1. Book Analyst analyzes existing book structure and content
2. Book Analyst creates revision plan (what needs updating/adding/removing)
3. Greenfield agents execute revision plan for updated content
4. Technical Editor ensures consistency between old and new content
5. Book Publisher prepares updated manuscript

---

## Architecture

### System Components

The Technical Writing Expansion Pack consists of five main component types:

#### 1. Agents (`agents/*.md`)
Markdown files with embedded YAML configuration defining AI personas.

**Structure**:
```markdown
# agent-name

ACTIVATION-NOTICE: ...

```yaml
agent:
  name: Agent Name
  id: agent-id
  title: Agent Title
  icon: 🎓
  whenToUse: Description
persona:
  role: Role description
  style: Communication style
  identity: Expertise areas
  focus: Primary focus
commands:
  - command-name: description
dependencies:
  tasks: [...]
  templates: [...]
  checklists: [...]
  data: [...]
```

## Startup Context

Detailed persona instructions...
```

#### 2. Workflows (`workflows/*.yaml`)
YAML files defining multi-agent orchestration sequences.

**Structure**:
```yaml
workflow:
  name: workflow-name
  description: Workflow description
  agents:
    primary: agent-id
    supporting: [agent-id, ...]
  steps:
    - step: 1
      agent: agent-id
      task: task-name
      template: template-name
      checklist: checklist-name
    - step: 2
      ...
  outputs:
    - output-name
```

#### 3. Templates (`templates/*.yaml`)
YAML files defining document structures with sections and LLM instructions.

**Structure**:
```yaml
template:
  name: template-name
  description: Template description
  elicit: true/false
elicitation:
  prompts:
    - prompt: Question to ask user
      id: variable-name
output:
  sections:
    - section: Section Name
      instructions: LLM instructions for section
      content: Template content with {{variables}}
```

#### 4. Tasks (`tasks/*.md`)
Markdown files with step-by-step executable instructions.

**Structure**:
```markdown
# task-name

## Purpose
What this task accomplishes

## Inputs
What's needed to start

## Steps
1. Step one
2. Step two
...

## Outputs
What this task produces

## Success Criteria
How to know task is complete
```

#### 5. Checklists (`checklists/*.md`)
Markdown files with quality assurance criteria.

**Structure**:
```markdown
# checklist-name

## Purpose
What this checklist validates

## Checklist

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
...

## Pass Criteria
All items must be checked
```

### Dependencies

Agents declare dependencies on templates, tasks, checklists, and data:

```yaml
dependencies:
  tasks:
    - create-doc.md
    - design-book-outline.md
  templates:
    - book-outline-tmpl.yaml
  checklists:
    - learning-objectives-checklist.md
  data:
    - bmad-kb.md
    - learning-frameworks.md
```

**Dependency Resolution**:
- Dependencies are loaded on-demand when agent executes command
- Recursive resolution (templates can reference tasks, etc.)
- Path mapping: `{root}/{type}/{name}` (e.g., `{root}/tasks/create-doc.md`)

### Build System

The Technical Writing Pack integrates with BMad's build system:

**Build Process**:
1. Reads agent/workflow/template definitions
2. Resolves dependencies recursively
3. Bundles content into `.txt` files for web UI
4. Outputs to `dist/` directory

**Build Commands**:
```bash
npm run build                    # Build everything
npm run build:agents            # Only agent bundles
npm run build:teams             # Only team bundles
npm run validate                # Validate all configs
```

### Web UI vs IDE Usage

The Technical Writing Pack works in two environments:

#### Web UI (Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude)
**Use For**: Planning phase (book outline, learning objectives, chapter structure)

**How It Works**:
1. Build system creates bundled `.txt` files with all dependencies
2. User uploads bundle to chat interface
3. Agent activates with full context
4. User executes planning workflows
5. Downloads deliverables (book outline, chapter plans)

**Advantages**:
- Rich context (entire knowledge base available)
- No token limits during planning
- Easy to share and collaborate

**Files**:
- `dist/agents/instructional-designer.txt` (bundled agent)
- `dist/teams/planning-team.txt` (multi-agent bundle)

#### IDE (Cursor, VS Code, Claude Code)
**Use For**: Development phase (writing content, creating code, reviewing)

**How It Works**:
1. Agents load individual `.md` files from expansion pack
2. Dependencies resolved on-demand from project structure
3. Agent works directly with project files
4. Changes committed to version control

**Advantages**:
- Direct file editing
- Code creation and testing
- Git integration
- Efficient for development

**Activation**:
```
/bmad-tw:tutorial-architect
/bmad-tw:code-curator
```
