## Typical Time Estimates

| Activity | Time |
|----------|------|
| Book planning (outline) | 20-33 hrs |
| Chapter outline | 3-5 hrs |
| Section writing (2-5 pages) | 5-10 hrs |
| Code example development | 1-3 hrs |

## Section-Driven Development Summary

**Break chapters into 2-5 page sections**:

1. **Plan Sections** - Instructional Designer creates section list
2. **Write Each Section** - Tutorial Architect + Code Curator
3. **Review Sections** - Technical Reviewer validates
4. **Assemble Chapter** - Technical Editor merges

**Benefits**:
- Manageable scope (small chunks)
- Parallel development possible
- Incremental progress visible
- Quality easier to maintain
