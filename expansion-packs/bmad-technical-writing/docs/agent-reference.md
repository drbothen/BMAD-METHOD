## Agent Selection Decision Tree

**I want to...**

### Plan a new book
‚Üí Start with **Instructional Designer** (`*create-book-outline`)
‚Üí Then **Tutorial Architect** for chapter-level structure
‚Üí Consider **Learning Path Designer** for complex prerequisite mapping

### Create tutorial content
‚Üí Use **Tutorial Architect** (`*create-tutorial`, `*write-walkthrough`)
‚Üí Collaborate with **Code Curator** for tested code examples
‚Üí Add **Exercise Creator** for practice problems

### Ensure code quality
‚Üí Use **Code Curator** (`*create-code-example`, `*test-all-examples`)
‚Üí Add **Sample Code Maintainer** for large repositories with CI/CD
‚Üí Add **Version Manager** for multi-version compatibility

### Review and refine content
‚Üí Use **Technical Reviewer** first (`*review-chapter` for accuracy)
‚Üí Then **Technical Editor** (`*edit-chapter` for clarity and style)
‚Üí Finish with **Book Publisher** for submission formatting

### Create specialized content
‚Üí **API Documenter** for API reference sections
‚Üí **Screenshot Specialist** for diagrams and visuals
‚Üí **Exercise Creator** for practice problem sets

### Update existing book
‚Üí Start with **Book Analyst** (`*analyze-book`, `*plan-revision`)
‚Üí Then coordinate other agents based on revision needs
‚Üí Use **Version Manager** for version migration

## Common Agent Workflows

### Greenfield Book (New Book from Scratch)

1. **Instructional Designer** - Create book outline with learning objectives
2. **Tutorial Architect** - Design chapter outlines with tutorial structure
3. **Code Curator** - Develop and test all code examples
4. **Exercise Creator** - Create practice problems and quizzes
5. **Technical Reviewer** - Validate technical accuracy
6. **Technical Editor** - Polish clarity and consistency
7. **Book Publisher** - Format and submit to publisher

### Section-Driven Development

1. **Tutorial Architect** - Outline section with tutorial steps
2. **Code Curator** - Create tested code examples for section
3. **Screenshot Specialist** - Design diagrams and visuals (if needed)
4. **Technical Reviewer** - Review section for accuracy
5. **Technical Editor** - Edit section for clarity
6. Repeat for next section

### Brownfield Book (2nd Edition Update)

1. **Book Analyst** - Analyze existing book, extract patterns
2. **Book Analyst** - Assess version impact, plan revision
3. **Version Manager** - Test code examples on new versions
4. **Code Curator** - Update failing code examples
5. **Technical Reviewer** - Review updated content
6. **Technical Editor** - Ensure consistency with existing style
7. **Book Publisher** - Reformat for submission

### API Reference Book

1. **Instructional Designer** - Structure book around API concepts
2. **API Documenter** - Generate comprehensive API documentation
3. **Code Curator** - Create usage examples for each API
4. **Tutorial Architect** - Create walkthroughs for common patterns
5. **Technical Reviewer** - Validate API accuracy
6. **Technical Editor** - Polish reference documentation
7. **Book Publisher** - Format for publication

## Integration Best Practices

### Agent Coordination Principles

1. **Sequential workflows**: Planning agents ‚Üí Content agents ‚Üí Review agents ‚Üí Publishing agent
2. **Parallel collaboration**: Code Curator + Screenshot Specialist can work simultaneously on same chapter
3. **Iteration cycles**: Technical Reviewer ‚Üí Author revisions ‚Üí Technical Editor ‚Üí Final review
4. **Specialist inclusion**: Add API Documenter, Screenshot Specialist, Exercise Creator as needed

### Dependency Sharing

Multiple agents share common dependencies:
- **All agents**: Use `create-doc.md`, `execute-checklist.md`, `bmad-kb.md`
- **Planning agents**: Share `learning-frameworks.md`, `book-structures.md`
- **Code agents**: Share `code-style-guides.md`
- **Review/Publishing agents**: Share `technical-writing-standards.md`, `publisher-guidelines.md`

### When to Use Optional Agents

- **Learning Path Designer**: Complex books with deep prerequisite dependencies (e.g., advanced algorithms, distributed systems)
- **Sample Code Maintainer**: Books with 50+ code examples, complex build systems, or CI/CD requirements
- **Version Manager**: Books covering Python 3.10/3.11/3.12 or Node 18/20/22 with breaking changes
