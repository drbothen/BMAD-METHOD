# Integration Guide - Technical Writing Expansion Pack

How to integrate the Technical Writing Expansion Pack with BMad core, other expansion packs, and development tools.

## BMad Core Integration

### When to Use Technical Writing vs Core Agents

**Use Technical Writing Expansion**:
- Writing technical books with code examples
- Creating tutorial-based content
- Need publisher-specific formatting
- Require learning objectives and pedagogical structure

**Use BMad Core**:
- Software project planning (PRD, architecture)
- Application development (coding, testing, deployment)
- Non-book technical documentation

**Use Both Together**:
- Writing a book about your software product
- Creating comprehensive documentation for your project

### Workflow Combination Example

**Scenario**: Writing a technical book about your software product

```
1. BMad Core: PM creates PRD for software
2. BMad Core: Architect designs system
3. BMad Core: Dev builds product
4. Technical Writing: Instructional Designer creates book outline
5. Technical Writing: Tutorial Architect writes chapters about the product
6. Technical Writing: Code Curator uses actual product code as examples
7. Technical Writing: Book Publisher prepares manuscript
```

### Agent Coordination

**PM (Core) â†’ Instructional Designer (TW)**:
- PM's product requirements inform book learning objectives
- User stories become tutorial sections

**Architect (Core) â†’ Tutorial Architect (TW)**:
- Architecture diagrams become book visuals
- System design informs chapter structure

**Dev (Core) â†’ Code Curator (TW)**:
- Product code becomes book examples
- Tests become tutorial verification

## Multi-Expansion Usage

### Technical Writing + Creative Writing

**Use Case**: Fiction with technical appendices, or technical books with narrative elements

**Example**:
- Creative Writing agents for engaging story-based introductions
- Technical Writing agents for code examples and tutorials
- Both expansions for mixed-format content

**Workflow**:
```
1. Creative Writing: Narrative Designer creates engaging scenarios
2. Technical Writing: Tutorial Architect builds tutorials using scenarios
3. Creative Writing: Beta Reader reviews narrative flow
4. Technical Writing: Technical Reviewer validates code
```

### Technical Writing + Infrastructure

**Use Case**: DevOps and cloud infrastructure books

**Example**:
- Infrastructure agents for cloud architecture examples
- Technical Writing agents for tutorial structure and publishing

**Workflow**:
```
1. Infrastructure: Platform Engineer creates deployment examples
2. Technical Writing: Code Curator integrates infrastructure code
3. Technical Writing: Tutorial Architect explains deployment processes
4. Infrastructure: DevOps specialist validates configurations
```

## Git Integration

### Managing Book Manuscripts in Git

**Recommended Structure**:
```
my-technical-book/
â”œâ”€â”€ .git/
â”œâ”€â”€ .bmad-core/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ core-config.yaml
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ planning/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ book-outline.md
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ chapter-outlines/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sections/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ chapter-01/
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ section-1.1.md
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ section-1.2.md
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ chapter-02/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ chapters/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ chapter-01.md
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ chapter-02.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ reviews/
â”œâ”€â”€ code-examples/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ chapter-01/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ chapter-02/
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

### Branch Strategies

**Feature Branch per Chapter**:
```bash
git checkout -b chapter-03-dictionaries
# Develop chapter 3
git commit -m "feat: complete section 3.1"
git commit -m "feat: complete section 3.2"
git checkout main
git merge chapter-03-dictionaries
```

**Section-Based Commits**:
```bash
# Commit after each section completes
git add docs/sections/chapter-01/section-1.1.md
git commit -m "feat(ch01): complete section 1.1 - Lists Introduction"

git add code-examples/chapter-01/section-1.1/
git commit -m "feat(ch01): add code examples for section 1.1"
```

### Collaboration Workflows

**Multiple Authors**:
```bash
# Author 1: Chapters 1-5
git checkout -b author1/chapters-1-5

# Author 2: Chapters 6-10
git checkout -b author2/chapters-6-10

# Merge completed chapters
git checkout main
git merge author1/chapters-1-5
git merge author2/chapters-6-10
```

## CI/CD Integration

### Automated Testing of Code Examples

**GitHub Actions Example**:
```yaml
name: Test Code Examples

on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'code-examples/**'

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: '3.10'
      - name: Test Chapter 1 Examples
        run: |
          cd code-examples/chapter-01
          pytest -v
      - name: Test Chapter 2 Examples
        run: |

- Validate markdown formatting
- Check spelling and grammar
- Auto-generate previews

### Collaboration
- Clear chapter ownership
- Regular sync meetings
- Shared style guide
- Code review for technical content

### Publishing
