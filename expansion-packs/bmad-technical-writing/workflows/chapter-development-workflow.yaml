  name: Write and Refine Chapter
  description: Complete chapter creation workflow from outline to publisher-ready manuscript. v2.0 - Orchestrates section-driven development (section-planning → section-development → chapter-assembly). Can also be used for traditional full-chapter writing. Emphasizes learning objectives, hands-on tutorials, tested code examples, and professional quality standards.

  sequence:
    - agent: tutorial-architect
      creates: chapter-outline.md
      requires: book-outline.md
      notes: "Create detailed chapter outline using *create-chapter-outline command. Define learning objectives, prerequisites, main sections, exercises, and code examples needed. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final chapter-outline.md to docs/outlines/chapter-{{chapter_number}}-outline.md"

    - agent: tutorial-architect
      creates: section-list.md
      orchestrates: section-planning-workflow
      requires: chapter-outline.md
      notes: "SECTION-DRIVEN APPROACH: Break chapter into 5-8 deliverable sections using section-planning-workflow. Each section 2-5 pages with clear acceptance criteria. Tutorial Architect and Instructional Designer identify section boundaries, create section plans, and validate learning flow. SAVE OUTPUT: docs/sections/chapter-{{chapter_number}}-section-list.md with all section plans. ALTERNATIVE: Skip this step for traditional full-chapter writing approach."

    - agent: tutorial-architect
      creates: completed-sections[]
      orchestrates: section-development-workflow
      requires: section-list.md
      notes: "SECTION-DRIVEN APPROACH: For each section in section-list, execute section-development-workflow (Code Curator develops code → Tutorial Architect writes section → Technical Reviewer reviews → Tutorial Architect finalizes). Sections can be developed in parallel if dependencies allow. Mark each section DONE when acceptance criteria met. SAVE OUTPUT: docs/sections/chapter-{{chapter_number}}/section-{{n}}-final.md for each section. ALTERNATIVE: Skip and use traditional drafting if not using section approach."

    - agent: tutorial-architect
      creates: chapter-integrated.md
      orchestrates: chapter-assembly-workflow
      requires: completed-sections[]
      notes: "SECTION-DRIVEN APPROACH: Execute chapter-assembly-workflow to merge all completed sections. Tutorial Architect merges and improves transitions → Instructional Designer validates learning flow → Technical Reviewer performs full chapter review → Tutorial Architect revises → Technical Editor copy edits → Tutorial Architect finalizes. SAVE OUTPUT: docs/chapters/chapter-{{chapter_number}}-final.md. ALTERNATIVE: For traditional approach, use original sequence (code-curator develops all code → tutorial-architect writes full draft → technical-reviewer reviews → revise → copy-edit → finalize)."

    - agent: tutorial-architect
      validates: chapter-final.md
      requires: chapter-integrated.md
      notes: "FINAL VALIDATION (both approaches): Run chapter-completeness-checklist. Verify all learning objectives addressed, code tested, quality gates passed. Mark chapter status as 'Ready for Publication'. This step ensures quality regardless of section-driven or traditional approach used."

  decision_guidance:
    when_to_use_section_driven:
      - Chapters 15+ pages (too large for single sitting)
      - Want incremental progress tracking ("5 of 8 sections complete")
      - Need parallel development (multiple sections in progress)
      - Want to review work-in-progress before full chapter done
      - Prefer story-driven iterative approach (BMad analog)

    when_to_use_traditional:
      - Short chapters (<10-12 pages)
      - Simple reference sections
      - Author prefers writing full chapter at once
      - Chapter already partially written

    general_when_to_use:
      - Writing technical book chapters with code examples
      - Creating tutorial-based training materials
      - Developing programming books or guides
      - Need for technical accuracy and professional polish
      - Multiple review stages required
      - Publisher quality standards must be met

  handoff_prompts:
    section_driven_flow:
      outline_to_planning: "Chapter outline complete with {{objective_count}} learning objectives and {{code_count}} code examples. Breaking into sections using section-planning-workflow."
      planning_to_development: "Section planning complete. {{section_count}} sections defined. Each section 2-5 pages with clear acceptance criteria. Begin section-development-workflow for each section."

      assembly_to_final: "Chapter assembly complete. All sections integrated with improved transitions. Full technical review and copy editing done. Final validation in progress."

    traditional_flow:
      architect_to_curator: "Chapter outline complete with {{code_count}} code examples identified. Save outline to docs/outlines/, then develop and test all code examples."
      curator_to_architect: "All code examples developed and tested in chapter-{{chapter_number}}/ folder. Tests passing. Ready for chapter draft writing."

      reviewer_to_architect: "Technical review complete. Found {{critical_count}} critical, {{major_count}} major, and {{minor_count}} minor issues. Review report at reviews/technical-review-chapter-{{chapter_number}}.md. Please address and revise."
      revised_to_editor: "Technical review issues addressed. Revised chapter ready for copy editing."

    both_approaches:
      editor_to_architect: "Copy editing complete. Made improvements to clarity, consistency, and style. Change summary attached. Please review and approve."
      architect_final: "Editorial changes approved. Chapter finalized at docs/chapters/chapter-{{chapter_number}}-final.md. Status: Ready for Publication."

  time_estimates:
    section_driven_approach:
      create_outline: "2-4 hours"
      plan_sections: "6-11 hours (section-planning-workflow)"
      develop_sections: "33-84 hours (5.5-10.5 hrs per section × 6-8 sections, can be parallel)"
      assemble_chapter: "13-24 hours (chapter-assembly-workflow)"
      total_time: "54-123 hours per chapter (significant parallel development possible)"

    traditional_approach:
      create_outline: "2-4 hours"
      develop_code: "4-8 hours (depending on complexity)"
      write_draft: "12-20 hours (15-30 page chapter)"
      technical_review: "3-5 hours"
      revision: "4-8 hours"
      copy_edit: "2-4 hours"
      finalization: "1-2 hours"
      total_time: "28-51 hours per chapter (sequential, no parallelization)"

    comparison_notes: "Section-driven has higher total time but allows parallel work and incremental progress. Traditional is faster for solo authors on short chapters."

  best_practices:
    general:
      - Start with strong learning objectives - they guide everything
      - Test ALL code before including in chapter
      - Get technical review before editorial polish
      - Address critical issues before moving forward
      - Maintain author voice during editing
      - Keep reader learning experience as top priority

    section_driven_specific:
      - Choose section-driven for chapters 15+ pages
      - Plan all sections before developing any (see dependencies)
      - Develop sections that have no dependencies in parallel
      - Mark sections DONE only when acceptance criteria met
      - Track progress: "Chapter 3: 5 of 8 sections complete"
      - Review sections incrementally (catch issues early)
      - Use section-driven for story-like iterative workflow

    traditional_specific:
      - Choose traditional for short chapters (<12 pages)
      - Good for solo authors who prefer full chapter flow
      - Faster for simple reference chapters
      - Use tutorial-section-tmpl for hands-on sections
      - Progressive difficulty in exercises (basic to advanced)
