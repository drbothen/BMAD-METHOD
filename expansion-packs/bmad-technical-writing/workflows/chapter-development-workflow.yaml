  name: Write and Refine Chapter
  description: Complete chapter creation workflow from outline to publisher-ready manuscript. v2.0 - Orchestrates section-driven development (section-planning → section-development → chapter-assembly). Can also be used for traditional full-chapter writing. Emphasizes learning objectives, hands-on tutorials, tested code examples, and professional quality standards.

      notes: "Create detailed chapter outline using *create-chapter-outline command. Define learning objectives, prerequisites, main sections, exercises, and code examples needed. Execute chapter-outline-checklist.md using execute-checklist task to validate structure, objectives, and integration with book.

      notes: "SECTION-DRIVEN APPROACH: Break chapter into 5-8 deliverable sections using section-planning-workflow. Each section 2-5 pages with clear acceptance criteria. Tutorial Architect and Instructional Designer identify section boundaries, create section plans, and validate learning flow. SAVE OUTPUT: {{config.manuscript.sections}}/chapter-{{chapter_number}}-section-list.md with all section plans. ALTERNATIVE: Skip this step for traditional full-chapter writing approach."

      notes: "SECTION-DRIVEN APPROACH: For each section in section-list, execute section-development-workflow (Code Curator develops code → Tutorial Architect writes section → Technical Reviewer reviews → Tutorial Architect finalizes). Sections can be developed in parallel if dependencies allow. Mark each section DONE when acceptance criteria met. SAVE OUTPUT: {{config.manuscript.sections}}/chapter-{{chapter_number}}/section-{{n}}-final.md for each section. ALTERNATIVE: Skip and use traditional drafting if not using section approach."

SAVE OUTPUT: {{config.manuscript.chapters}}/chapter-{{chapter_number}}-final.md. ALTERNATIVE: For traditional approach, use original sequence (code-curator develops all code → tutorial-architect writes full draft → technical-reviewer reviews → revise → humanize if AI-assisted → copy-edit → finalize)."

REQUIRED when AI tools assisted drafting (expand-outline-to-draft or similar). Execute generative-ai-compliance-checklist.md (baseline), apply pattern removal (AI vocabulary, metaphors, generic examples, impersonal voice, sentence uniformity, filler, rigid structure), validate with humanization-checklist.md (target: ≥80% pass, <20% AI patterns). SAVE OUTPUT: {{config.manuscript.chapters}}/chapter-{{chapter_number}}-humanized.md. SKIP: If content is fully human-written without AI assistance. TIME ESTIMATE: 2-4 hours."

      notes: "FINAL VALIDATION (both approaches): Run chapter-completeness-checklist. Verify all learning objectives addressed, code tested, quality gates passed. Mark chapter status as 'Ready for Publication'. This step ensures quality regardless of section-driven or traditional approach used."

  decision_guidance:
    when_to_use_section_driven:
      - Chapters 15+ pages (too large for single sitting)
      - Want incremental progress tracking ("5 of 8 sections complete")
      - Need parallel development (multiple sections in progress)
      - Want to review work-in-progress before full chapter done
      - Prefer story-driven iterative approach (BMad analog)

    when_to_use_traditional:
      - Short chapters (<10-12 pages)
      - Simple reference sections
      - Author prefers writing full chapter at once
      - Chapter already partially written

    general_when_to_use:
      - Writing technical book chapters with code examples
      - Creating tutorial-based training materials
      - Developing programming books or guides
      - Need for technical accuracy and professional polish
      - Multiple review stages required
      - Publisher quality standards must be met

    when_not_to_use:
      - Simple blog posts or articles (use simplified workflow)
      - Reference documentation only (no tutorials)
      - Quick drafts without review requirements

    when_to_humanize:
      - AI tools used for drafting (expand-outline-to-draft, ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
      - generative-ai-compliance-checklist.md detects AI patterns (score >20%)
      - Technical editor flags content as "AI-like"
      - PacktPub or publisher submission requires AI content declaration
      - ALWAYS humanize before technical review (saves reviewer time, avoids friction)

      assemble_chapter: "13-24 hours (chapter-assembly-workflow)"
      total_time: "54-123 hours per chapter (significant parallel development possible)"

    traditional_approach:
      create_outline: "2-4 hours"
      develop_code: "4-8 hours (depending on complexity)"
      write_draft: "12-20 hours (15-30 page chapter)"

      total_time: "28-51 hours per chapter (no AI), 30-55 hours (with AI + humanization)"

    humanization_specific:
      baseline_detection: "15-30 minutes (execute generative-ai-compliance-checklist)"
      pattern_removal: "1.5-3 hours (systematic AI pattern removal)"
      validation: "15-30 minutes (execute humanization-checklist)"
      total_humanization: "2-4 hours per chapter"
      note: "Investment prevents negative reviews, publisher rejection, reader complaints"

    comparison_notes: "Section-driven has higher total time but allows parallel work and incremental progress. Traditional is faster for solo authors on short chapters. Humanization adds 2-4 hours when AI-assisted drafting used but critical for quality and publisher compliance."

  best_practices:
    general:
      - Start with strong learning objectives - they guide everything
      - Test ALL code before including in chapter
      - Get technical review before editorial polish
      - Address critical issues before moving forward
      - Maintain author voice during editing
      - Keep reader learning experience as top priority

    section_driven_specific:
      - Choose section-driven for chapters 15+ pages
      - Plan all sections before developing any (see dependencies)
      - Develop sections that have no dependencies in parallel
      - Mark sections DONE only when acceptance criteria met
      - Track progress: "Chapter 3: 5 of 8 sections complete"
      - Review sections incrementally (catch issues early)
      - Use section-driven for story-like iterative workflow

    traditional_specific:
      - Choose traditional for short chapters (<12 pages)
      - Good for solo authors who prefer full chapter flow
      - Faster for simple reference chapters
      - Use tutorial-section-tmpl for hands-on sections
      - Progressive difficulty in exercises (basic to advanced)

    humanization_specific:
      - ALWAYS humanize AI-assisted content before technical review (saves reviewer time)
      - Execute generative-ai-compliance-checklist first (baseline measurement critical)
      - Systematic approach: follow humanize-ai-drafted-chapter steps 1-11 in order
      - Target ≥80% pass rate on humanization-checklist (≤20% AI patterns remaining)
      - Document AI use transparently (PacktPub requirement)
      - Quality over speed: 2-4 hours is normal and worthwhile investment
      - Preserve technical accuracy while humanizing (never sacrifice correctness for voice)
      - Final validation at copy-edit (Step 10 targets <5% AI patterns)
