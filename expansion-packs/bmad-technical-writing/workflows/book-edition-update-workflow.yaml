  name: Update Book for New Edition
  description: Complete workflow for updating existing technical book to 2nd/3rd edition with technology version updates. Coordinates book analysis, revision planning, code pattern extraction, chapter updates, testing, technical review, learning flow validation, and editorial polish for brownfield book authoring.

  sequence:
    - agent: book-analyst
      creates: book-analysis-report.md
      requires:
        - existing_book_path
        - revision_motivation
      notes: "Analyze existing book completely using *analyze-book command (runs analyze-existing-book.md task). Understand structure, code inventory, technical currency, writing patterns, cross-references, and issues. Output comprehensive analysis report covering metadata, structure, code versions, outdated content, style patterns, and recommendations. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy report to docs/analysis/{{book_title}}-analysis-report.md"

    - agent: book-analyst
      creates: revision-plan.md
      requires: book-analysis-report.md
      notes: "Create strategic revision plan using *plan-revision command (runs plan-book-revision.md task). Define scope (full edition? specific chapters?), document technology version changes (e.g., Python 3.9→3.12), create chapter revision matrix with complexity/effort/priority for each chapter, plan testing strategy, define timeline with milestones, set success criteria, assess risks. Use templates/revision-plan-tmpl.yaml. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy plan to {{config.manuscript.planning}}/{{book_title}}-revision-plan.md"

    - agent: book-analyst
      creates: code-patterns.md
      requires: book-analysis-report.md
      notes: "Extract code style patterns using *extract-patterns command (runs extract-code-patterns.md task). Learn existing import organization, naming conventions, comment styles, error handling patterns, code structure patterns, formatting choices, file organization. Generate style guide for maintaining consistency in updated code. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy to docs/style/{{book_title}}-code-patterns.md"

    - agent: tutorial-architect
      updates: chapters (iterative)
      requires:
        - revision-plan.md
        - code-patterns.md
      notes: "Update chapters according to revision plan using update-chapter-for-version.md task for each chapter marked for revision. Follow priority order (Critical→Important→Nice-to-have). For each chapter: update imports, replace deprecated APIs, adopt new syntax, test code on target versions, revise text for accuracy, add migration notes. Follow code-patterns.md for consistency. Use version-update-checklist.md to verify each chapter. TRACK PROGRESS: Update chapter revision matrix as chapters complete."

    - agent: code-curator
      tests: all_updated_code
      requires: updated chapters
      notes: "Test all updated code examples using *test-code command (runs test-{{config.codeExamples.root}}.md task). Test on exact target versions (e.g., Python 3.12, Node 20), verify all examples run without errors, check outputs match text, run regression tests on unchanged examples, test across platforms (Windows/macOS/Linux if applicable). Document test results. SAVE OUTPUT: Create test-results.md with pass/fail for every example."

    - agent: technical-reviewer
      reviews: updated chapters
      requires: tested code
      notes: "Technical review of all revised chapters using *review-accuracy command. Verify technical accuracy, check code follows current best practices, validate new syntax usage is appropriate, ensure deprecated features are fully replaced, confirm security best practices are current, verify version-specific content is correct. Provide feedback using incorporate-reviewer-feedback.md task format. SAVE OUTPUT: Create technical-review-notes.md"

    - agent: instructional-designer
      validates: learning_flow
      requires: updated chapters
      notes: "Verify learning progression intact after revisions using *validate-learning-path command. Check prerequisite flow still works (chapter dependencies maintained), concepts build logically, difficulty curve is smooth, no knowledge gaps introduced by changes, learning objectives still met, exercises still appropriate. Use learning-objectives-checklist.md and prerequisite-clarity-checklist.md. SAVE OUTPUT: Create learning-flow-validation.md"

    - agent: technical-editor
      polishes: final_chapters
      requires:
        - technical review complete
        - learning flow validated
      notes: "Editorial polish for consistency and quality using *review-consistency command. Check voice and tone match original book, terminology is consistent (old and new content), heading styles consistent, cross-references accurate (chapter numbers, section numbers), code patterns followed, formatting consistent throughout. Use existing-book-integration-checklist.md and revision-completeness-checklist.md. SAVE OUTPUT: Create editorial-review-notes.md with final approval or change requests."

  time_estimates:
    book_analysis: "8-12 hours (thorough analysis of existing book)"
    revision_planning: "8-12 hours (strategic planning and stakeholder alignment)"
    pattern_extraction: "4-6 hours (code style analysis)"
    chapter_updates: "Varies by chapter: Low=2-4h, Medium=5-10h, High=12-20h per chapter"
    code_testing: "1-2 hours per chapter (comprehensive testing)"
    technical_review: "2-3 hours per chapter"
    learning_flow_validation: "6-10 hours (full book assessment)"
    editorial_review: "1-2 hours per chapter"
    total_time_small_book: "200-300 hours for 10-chapter book with medium complexity"
    total_time_large_book: "400-600 hours for 20-chapter book with high complexity"

  best_practices:
    - Thorough analysis first - understand before changing
    - Extract patterns early - consistency is critical in brownfield
    - Prioritize critical issues - not all chapters need equal effort
    - Test incrementally - don't wait until all chapters are done
    - Maintain learning flow - revisions shouldn't break pedagogy
    - Document everything - future editions will need this history
    - Follow extracted patterns - consistency matters more than "better" style
    - Plan realistic timeline - edition updates take longer than expected
    - Get stakeholder buy-in - revision plan needs approval
    - Version everything - use git tags for edition milestones
