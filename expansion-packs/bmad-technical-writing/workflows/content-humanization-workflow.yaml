  description: Systematic workflow for transforming AI-generated technical content into natural, human-sounding writing. Guides content humanizers through pre-generation prompt engineering, AI pattern analysis, post-generation editing, and quality verification. Ensures content maintains technical accuracy while improving perplexity, burstiness, voice consistency, and emotional resonance.

  severity_definitions:
    critical:
      description: "AI patterns so obvious they immediately signal machine generation"
      examples:
        - High-priority AI words (delve, leverage, robust, harness) appear frequently
        - Extreme sentence uniformity (all 15-20 words with < 3-word variation)
        - Formulaic transitions in every paragraph
        - Complete absence of voice or personal markers
        - Technical inaccuracies from humanization attempts
      action: "Must address before publication—significant humanization required"

    major:
      description: "Noticeable AI patterns affecting naturalness and engagement"
      examples:
        - Moderate AI vocabulary (3-5 instances per 1000 words)
        - Some sentence uniformity but not extreme
        - Several formulaic transitions present
        - Minimal voice or authentic perspective
        - Overly abstract without specific grounding
      action: "Should address through systematic humanization workflow"

    minor:
      description: "Subtle AI patterns that could be improved but don't critically harm quality"
      examples:
        - Occasional AI vocabulary (1-2 instances)
        - Mostly varied sentences with some uniform sections
        - One or two formulaic transitions
        - Some voice present but could be stronger
        - Mix of specific and generic examples
      action: "Address if time permits, especially for premium content"

  best_practices:
    - Always analyze before editing (don't guess at what needs fixing)
    - Prioritize high-impact techniques (sentence variation, vocabulary) first
    - Never sacrifice technical accuracy for naturalness or style
    - Test all code examples after editing to verify nothing broke
    - Use read-aloud test to catch unnatural phrasings other checks miss
    - Track what needed most work to improve future prompts
    - Budget 70-80% of content creation time for humanization, not generation
    - Consider regeneration with humanization prompt for extensively poor content
    - Maintain appropriate formality for domain (tutorials vs. API docs)
    - Add genuine examples and voice markers, not fake anecdotes
    - Remember goal is authentic human quality, not just detection evasion
    - Document lessons learned to prevent same issues in future content

  common_pitfalls:
    - Changing technical terms to incorrect "synonyms" during vocabulary replacement
    - Simplifying explanations to point where they become technically wrong
    - Adding specific details that seem realistic but are actually inaccurate
    - Removing important qualifiers or caveats during sentence restructuring
    - Over-editing until content becomes convoluted rather than clear
    - Forgetting to verify code examples after making surrounding text more natural
    - Applying generic humanization to specialized content requiring domain precision
    - Mechanically applying rules without using judgment and context
    - Aiming for perfection rather than "noticeably human and engaging"
    - Skipping read-aloud test (catches issues other methods miss)
