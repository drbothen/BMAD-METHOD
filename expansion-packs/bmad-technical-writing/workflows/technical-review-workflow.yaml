  decision_guidance:
    when_to_use:
      - Chapter draft complete and ready for expert review
      - Need comprehensive technical validation
      - Code examples need expert verification
      - Before editorial polish (technical review first)
      - Quality standards require expert review

    when_not_to_use:
      - Chapter still in early draft (premature for review)
      - Only editorial review needed (use editor workflow)
      - Self-review by original author (biased review)

      examples:
        - Suboptimal code practices
        - Missing error handling
        - Outdated but functional approaches
        - Incomplete explanations of complex concepts
      action: "Should fix before editorial review"

    compile_to_author: "Technical review complete for chapter {{chapter_number}}. Report available at reviews/{{chapter_number}}/technical-review-report.md. Recommendation: {{revision_priority}}."

  time_estimates:
    accuracy_check: "2-3 hours (15-30 page chapter)"
    code_review: "2-4 hours (depending on code complexity)"
    best_practices_check: "1-2 hours"
    compile_report: "1-2 hours"
    total_time: "6-11 hours per chapter"

  best_practices:
    - Review with beginner's mindset (assume no prior knowledge beyond prerequisites)
    - Test ALL code exactly as shown in chapter
    - Focus on what reader will experience
    - Categorize findings by severity objectively
    - Provide specific, actionable recommendations
    - Note both problems AND strengths
    - Consider target audience when assessing depth
    - Flag security issues immediately (critical)
    - Verify version compatibility explicitly
    - Be thorough but constructive in feedback
