  sequence:
    - agent: tutorial-architect
      creates: chapter-integrated.md
      requires: completed-sections[]
      task: merge-sections.md
      notes: "Execute merge-sections.md task to systematically merge all completed sections into single chapter file. Preserve section content. Add chapter introduction (if not in section 1) and chapter summary (if not in final section). Verify all sections present in correct order. SAVE OUTPUT: Create {{config.manuscript.chapters}}/chapter-{{chapter_number}}-integrated.md"

      requires: chapter-integrated.md
      task: enhance-transitions.md
      notes: "Execute enhance-transitions.md task to review and improve transitions between sections. Add bridging paragraphs where sections feel disconnected. Ensure smooth flow from one concept to next. Check that prerequisites mentioned in earlier sections are fulfilled. Add cross-references where helpful. SAVE OUTPUT: Update chapter-integrated.md with improved transitions."

    - agent: instructional-designer
      validates: chapter-integrated.md
      requires: chapter-integrated.md
      notes: "Validate overall learning progression using validate-learning-flow.md task. Verify chapter builds concepts logically. Check that exercises progress from easy to challenging. Ensure no learning gaps or concept jumps. Confirm chapter learning objectives (from chapter outline) are achieved. SAVE OUTPUT: Create learning-flow-validation.md with findings."

    - agent: technical-reviewer
      reviews: chapter-integrated.md
      requires: chapter-integrated.md
      notes: "Perform comprehensive technical review of full chapter using verify-accuracy.md and check-best-practices.md tasks. Verify technical accuracy across all sections, test all code examples in sequence, check security best practices, assess performance implications. Use technical-accuracy-checklist, security-best-practices-checklist, and performance-considerations-checklist. SAVE OUTPUT: Create reviews/technical-review-chapter-{{chapter_number}}.md using technical-review-report-tmpl."

    - agent: tutorial-architect
      revises: chapter-integrated.md
      requires:
        - learning-flow-validation.md
        - technical-review-report.md
      notes: "Incorporate all review feedback. Address instructional designer learning flow issues. Fix all critical and major technical issues from technical review. Update code examples if needed. Re-test modified code. SAVE OUTPUT: Update chapter-integrated.md with all revisions."

    - agent: technical-editor
      edits: chapter-integrated.md
      requires: revised-chapter-integrated.md
      notes: "Perform professional copy edit using *edit-chapter command. Improve clarity, check terminology consistency, enhance transitions, verify publisher style compliance, review accessibility. Use accessibility-checklist and publisher-specific checklist. SAVE OUTPUT: Create edited-chapter.md with change summary."

    - agent: tutorial-architect
      finalizes: chapter-final.md
      requires:
        - edited-chapter.md
        - chapter-completeness-checklist.md
      notes: "Review and approve editorial changes. Verify technical accuracy preserved during editing. Run chapter-completeness-checklist to ensure all requirements met. Mark chapter status as 'Ready for Publication'. SAVE OUTPUT: Create {{config.manuscript.chapters}}/chapter-{{chapter_number}}-final.md as publisher-ready manuscript."

  decision_guidance:
    when_to_use:
      - All chapter sections marked DONE
      - Using section-driven development approach
      - Ready to integrate sections into cohesive chapter
      - Need full chapter review and polish
      - Preparing chapter for publication

    when_not_to_use:
      - Sections still in development (wait until all DONE)
      - Chapter written as single unit (already integrated)
      - Quick draft without full review process

  quality_gates:
    integration_complete:
      - All sections merged in correct order
      - Chapter introduction present
      - Chapter summary present
      - No missing sections

    revise_chapter: "3-6 hours (depending on issues)"
    copy_edit: "2-4 hours"
    finalize_chapter: "1-2 hours"
    total_time: "13-24 hours per chapter"

  best_practices:
    - Wait until ALL sections DONE before assembly
    - Preserve section content - don't rewrite during merge
    - Focus on transitions and flow, not content changes
    - Test all code examples in sequence (order matters)
    - Address critical issues before copy editing
    - Maintain author voice during editorial polish
    - Use completeness checklist as final gate
    - Chapter assembly is Sprint Review - celebrate progress
    - All sections done = major milestone achieved
