      requires: polished outline
      notes: "Verify publisher requirements and format compliance. Check outline matches publisher chapter count guidelines, technical depth appropriate for series/imprint, format follows publisher template, timeline is realistic for publication schedule. Use publisher-specific checklist (packtpub-submission-checklist.md, oreilly-format-checklist.md, or manning-meap-checklist.md). SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final approved outline to docs/planning/book-outline-final.md and set status to 'Ready for Chapter Development'"

  best_practices:
    - Start with clear target audience definition - affects everything
    - Research competitive titles before outlining
    - Ensure realistic prerequisites (don't assume too much)
    - Build difficulty progressively (avoid knowledge jumps)
    - Plan exercises early (they affect chapter structure)
    - Verify publisher requirements before deep work
    - Get outline approved before writing any chapters
    - Consider reader's learning journey, not just content coverage
