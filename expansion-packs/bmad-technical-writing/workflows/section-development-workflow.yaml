  sequence:
    - agent: code-curator
      creates: section-code-examples/
      requires: section-plan.md
      notes: "Develop all code examples identified in section plan. Use *create-example for each code example. Test code thoroughly - all examples must run correctly. Follow coding best practices, include error handling, and add inline comments. SAVE OUTPUT: Create code examples in chapter-{{chapter_number}}/section-{{section_number}}/ with tests."

    - agent: code-curator
      tests: section-code-examples/
      requires: section-code-examples/
      notes: "Test all code examples. Verify correct output, edge cases handled, error messages clear. Run linting and security checks. Document test results. Ensure examples demonstrate concepts clearly. SAVE OUTPUT: Test results and any bug fixes committed to repository."

    - agent: tutorial-architect
      creates: section-draft.md
      requires:
        - section-plan.md
        - section-code-examples/
        - chapter-outline.md
      notes: "Write section content (2-5 pages). Follow section plan learning objectives and content plan. Include concept explanation, tutorial walkthrough with code examples inline, and practical applications. Address prerequisites and connect to previous sections. SAVE OUTPUT: Create docs/sections/chapter-{{chapter_number}}/section-{{section_number}}-draft.md"

    - agent: technical-reviewer
      reviews: section-draft.md
      requires: section-draft.md
      notes: "Quick technical review of section (focused review, not full chapter review). Verify technical accuracy, code correctness, and completeness of explanations. Check for security issues or bad practices. Use technical-accuracy-checklist for focused review. SAVE OUTPUT: Create section-review-notes.md with findings (critical/major/minor issues)."

    - agent: tutorial-architect
      revises: section-draft.md
      requires: section-review-notes.md
      notes: "Incorporate technical review feedback. Address all critical and major issues. Update code examples if needed (coordinate with code-curator). Re-test revised code. SAVE OUTPUT: Update section-draft.md with revisions."

    - agent: tutorial-architect
      finalizes: section-final.md
      requires: revised-section-draft.md
      notes: "Verify section meets all success criteria from section plan. Check learning objectives addressed, code tested, length appropriate (2-5 pages), transitions clear. Mark section status as DONE. SAVE OUTPUT: Create docs/sections/chapter-{{chapter_number}}/section-{{section_number}}-final.md and mark in section list as complete."

  decision_guidance:
    when_to_use:
      - Developing one section (2-5 pages) from section plan
      - Incremental chapter development approach
      - Want focused work units with clear done criteria
      - Tracking progress section by section
      - Parallel section development needed

    when_not_to_use:
      - Writing entire chapter at once (use chapter-development-workflow)
      - Simple reference sections without code
      - Section already written (use for new sections only)

  quality_gates:
    code_complete:
      - All section code examples developed
      - All code tested and passing
      - Code follows best practices
      - Examples demonstrate concepts clearly
      - Error handling included
      - Inline comments present

    draft_complete:
      - Section length 2-5 pages (appropriate granularity)
      - Learning objective(s) addressed
      - Code examples integrated and explained
      - Tutorial walkthrough clear and step-by-step
      - Prerequisites referenced
      - Transitions to next section present

    technical_review_passed:
      - No critical technical errors
      - Code accurate and tested
      - Explanations technically correct
      - No security issues or bad practices
      - Checklist: technical-accuracy-checklist.md

    section_done:
      - All success criteria from section plan met
      - Technical review approved
      - Code tested and working
      - Length appropriate (2-5 pages)
      - Ready to integrate into chapter

  handoff_prompts:
    plan_to_curator: "Section plan complete: {{section_title}}. Learning objective: {{objective}}. {{code_count}} code examples needed. Develop and test all code."
    curator_to_architect: "Code examples complete for {{section_title}}. All {{example_count}} examples tested and passing. Code in chapter-{{chapter_number}}/section-{{section_number}}/. Ready for section writing."
    architect_to_reviewer: "Section draft complete: {{section_title}} ({{page_count}} pages). Learning objective addressed with {{example_count}} code examples. Quick technical review needed."
    reviewer_to_architect: "Technical review complete. Found {{critical_count}} critical and {{major_count}} major issues. Review notes available. Please revise and address."
    architect_final: "Section {{section_id}} DONE. All acceptance criteria met. {{page_count}} pages with {{example_count}} tested code examples. Section marked complete in section list."

  time_estimates:
    develop_code: "1-2 hours (per section, 1-3 examples)"
    test_code: "30 minutes - 1 hour"
    write_section: "2-4 hours (2-5 pages)"
    technical_review: "30 minutes - 1 hour (focused section review)"
    revise_section: "1-2 hours"
    verify_criteria: "30 minutes"
    total_time: "5.5-10.5 hours per section"

  best_practices:
    - Start with code - test it before writing explanations
    - Follow section plan learning objectives closely
    - Keep section focused (1-2 objectives max)
    - Section should be independently reviewable
    - Mark section DONE only when ALL criteria met
    - Good sections are 2-5 pages (not too small, not too large)
    - Each section is a natural stopping point
    - Connect to previous section, preview next section
    - Technical review is focused (not full chapter review)
