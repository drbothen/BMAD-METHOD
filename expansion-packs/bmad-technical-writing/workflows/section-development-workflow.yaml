  name: Write and Review Section
  description: Complete development of one section (2-5 pages) - the "story" unit of book writing. Develops code examples, writes section content, and reviews for technical accuracy. Section is DONE when it meets acceptance criteria from section plan.
  type: section-writing
  project_types:
    - technical-book
    - tutorial-series

  sequence:
    - agent: code-curator
      creates: section-{{config.codeExamples.root}}/
      requires: section-plan.md
      notes: "Develop all code examples identified in section plan. Use *create-example for each code example. Test code thoroughly - all examples must run correctly. Follow coding best practices, include error handling, and add inline comments. SAVE OUTPUT: Create code examples in chapter-{{chapter_number}}/section-{{section_number}}/ with tests."

    - agent: code-curator
      tests: section-{{config.codeExamples.root}}/
      requires: section-{{config.codeExamples.root}}/
      notes: "Test all code examples. Verify correct output, edge cases handled, error messages clear. Run linting and security checks. Document test results. Ensure examples demonstrate concepts clearly. SAVE OUTPUT: Test results and any bug fixes committed to repository."

    - agent: tutorial-architect
      creates: section-draft.md
      requires:
        - section-plan.md
        - section-{{config.codeExamples.root}}/
        - chapter-outline.md
      notes: "Write section content (2-5 pages). Follow section plan learning objectives and content plan. Include concept explanation, tutorial walkthrough with code examples inline, and practical applications. Address prerequisites and connect to previous sections. SAVE OUTPUT: Create {{config.manuscript.sections}}/chapter-{{chapter_number}}/section-{{section_number}}-draft.md"

    - agent: tutorial-architect
      creates: section-humanized.md
      requires: section-draft.md
      notes: "HUMANIZATION STEP (if AI-assisted drafting used): If AI tools assisted with section drafting, execute humanize-ai-drafted-chapter.md task (adapted for sections) to remove AI patterns. Systematic pattern removal: AI vocabulary, metaphors, generic examples, impersonal voice, sentence uniformity, etc. Validate with humanization-checklist.md (target: ≥80% pass, <20% AI patterns). SAVE OUTPUT: {{config.manuscript.sections}}/chapter-{{chapter_number}}/section-{{section_number}}-humanized.md. SKIP: If section is fully human-written without AI assistance. TIME ESTIMATE: 30-60 minutes per section."

    - agent: technical-reviewer
      reviews: section-draft.md
      requires: section-humanized.md OR section-draft.md
      notes: "Quick technical review of section (focused review, not full chapter review). Verify technical accuracy, code correctness, and completeness of explanations. Check for security issues or bad practices. Use technical-accuracy-checklist for focused review. SAVE OUTPUT: Create section-review-notes.md with findings (critical/major/minor issues)."

    - agent: tutorial-architect
      revises: section-draft.md
      requires: section-review-notes.md
      notes: "Incorporate technical review feedback. Address all critical and major issues. Update code examples if needed (coordinate with code-curator). Re-test revised code. SAVE OUTPUT: Update section-draft.md with revisions."

    - agent: tutorial-architect
      finalizes: section-final.md
      requires: revised-section-draft.md
      notes: "Verify section meets all success criteria from section plan. Execute section-completeness-checklist.md using execute-checklist task to validate length, structure, learning objectives, code integration, tutorial quality, transitions, technical accuracy, and readability. Mark section status as DONE only when checklist passes. SAVE OUTPUT: Create {{config.manuscript.sections}}/chapter-{{chapter_number}}/section-{{section_number}}-final.md and mark in section list as complete."

  decision_guidance:
    when_to_use:
      - Developing one section (2-5 pages) from section plan
      - Incremental chapter development approach
      - Want focused work units with clear done criteria
      - Tracking progress section by section
      - Parallel section development needed

    when_not_to_use:
      - Writing entire chapter at once (use chapter-development-workflow)
      - Simple reference sections without code
      - Section already written (use for new sections only)

  quality_gates:
    code_complete:
      - All section code examples developed
      - All code tested and passing
      - Code follows best practices
      - Examples demonstrate concepts clearly
      - Error handling included
      - Inline comments present

    humanization_complete:
      - humanization-checklist.md executed (if AI-assisted)
      - AI pattern score reduced by ≥50% from baseline
      - AI pattern score <20% (target for humanization step)
      - Change log documents all humanization changes
      - Note: Skip this gate if content is fully human-written without AI assistance

    draft_complete:
      - Section length 2-5 pages (appropriate granularity)
      - Learning objective(s) addressed
      - Code examples integrated and explained

      - All success criteria from section plan met
      - Technical review approved
      - Code tested and working
      - Length appropriate (2-5 pages)
      - Ready to integrate into chapter
      - Checklist: section-completeness-checklist.md passes

  handoff_prompts:
    plan_to_curator: "Section plan complete: {{section_title}}. Learning objective: {{objective}}. {{code_count}} code examples needed. Develop and test all code."
    curator_to_architect: "Code examples complete for {{section_title}}. All {{example_count}} examples tested and passing. Code in chapter-{{chapter_number}}/section-{{section_number}}/. Ready for section writing."
    draft_to_humanization: "Section draft complete: {{section_title}} ({{page_count}} pages). AI assistance was used during drafting. Executing humanization pass to remove AI patterns before technical review."
    humanization_to_review: "Humanization complete for {{section_title}}. AI pattern score reduced from {{baseline_score}}% to {{final_score}}% ({{improvement}}% improvement). Section now reads as authentically human-written. Ready for technical review."
    humanization_skipped: "Section {{section_title}} drafted without AI assistance. Skipping humanization step. Proceeding directly to technical review."
    architect_to_reviewer: "Section ready for review: {{section_title}} ({{page_count}} pages). Learning objective addressed with {{example_count}} code examples. Quick technical review needed."
    reviewer_to_architect: "Technical review complete. Found {{critical_count}} critical and {{major_count}} major issues. Review notes available. Please revise and address."
    architect_final: "Section {{section_id}} DONE. All acceptance criteria met. {{page_count}} pages with {{example_count}} tested code examples. Section marked complete in section list."

  time_estimates:
    develop_code: "1-2 hours (per section, 1-3 examples)"
    test_code: "30 minutes - 1 hour"
    write_section: "2-4 hours (2-5 pages)"
    humanize_if_ai_assisted: "30-60 minutes (if AI drafting used, skip if fully human-written)"
    technical_review: "30 minutes - 1 hour (focused section review)"
    revise_section: "1-2 hours"
    verify_criteria: "30 minutes"
    total_time: "5.5-10.5 hours per section (no AI), 6-11.5 hours (with AI + humanization)"

  best_practices:
    - Start with code - test it before writing explanations
    - Follow section plan learning objectives closely
    - Keep section focused (1-2 objectives max)
    - Section should be independently reviewable
    - ALWAYS humanize AI-assisted sections before technical review (saves reviewer time)
    - Humanization for sections is faster than chapters (30-60 min vs 2-4 hours)
    - Mark section DONE only when ALL criteria met
    - Good sections are 2-5 pages (not too small, not too large)
    - Each section is a natural stopping point
    - Connect to previous section, preview next section
    - Technical review is focused (not full chapter review)
