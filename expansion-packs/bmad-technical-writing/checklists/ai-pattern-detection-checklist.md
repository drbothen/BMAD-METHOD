# AI Pattern Detection Checklist

<!-- Powered by BMAD™ Core -->

## Purpose

Systematically identify AI-characteristic patterns in content to diagnose humanization needs and prioritize editing efforts. Use this checklist before beginning humanization to create a targeted improvement plan.

## When to Use

- Before humanization editing begins
- When assessing content quality
- When troubleshooting "robotic" feel
- When comparing before/after humanization results
- When training on AI pattern recognition

## Quick Decision Guide

### Should I Edit or Regenerate?

**Edit the existing content if**:

- ✅ Word count is appropriate

**Regenerate with humanization prompt if**:
- ❌ Multiple critical issues across all dimensions
- ❌ Content is too generic/abstract throughout
