# Humanization Quality Checklist

<!-- Powered by BMAD™ Core -->

## Purpose

Verify that humanized content meets quality standards across all critical dimensions: naturalness, technical accuracy, readability, voice consistency, and audience appropriateness. Use this checklist after humanization editing to ensure comprehensive quality.

## When to Use

- After completing humanization editing
- Before publishing AI-assisted content
- During peer review of humanized content
- When assessing humanization effectiveness
- As final quality gate before release

## Section 1: Vocabulary Quality

### AI Vocabulary Removal

**High-Priority AI Words** (should be eliminated):

- [ ] No instances of "delve" / "delving"
- [ ] No instances of "leverage" / "leveraging"
- [ ] No instances of "robust" / "robustness"

- [ ] No instances of "underscore" / "underscoring"
- [ ] No instances of "facilitate" / "facilitating"
- [ ] No instances of "pivotal"

**Acceptable Count**: 0-1 total across document
**Target**: Zero instances

### Transition Word Naturalness

**Formulaic Transitions** (should be replaced or removed):
