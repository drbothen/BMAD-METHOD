# Learning Objectives Quality Checklist

Use this checklist to validate that learning objectives are well-crafted and effective.

## Action Verb Usage

- [ ] Each objective uses an action verb from Bloom's Taxonomy
- [ ] Verbs are appropriate for the target skill level (Remember/Understand for beginners, Evaluate/Create for advanced)
- [ ] Verbs are specific (not vague like "know" or "understand")
- [ ] Examples: Implement, Analyze, Design, Debug, Evaluate

## Measurability

- [ ] Each objective is measurable and testable
- [ ] Success criteria can be defined
- [ ] Assessment method is clear (exercise, project, quiz, etc.)
- [ ] Objective states what readers will DO, not just "learn"

## Specificity

- [ ] Objectives are specific, not vague or general
- [ ] Technology/tools are named (e.g., "JWT tokens" not "authentication")
- [ ] Context is provided where needed
- [ ] Scope is clear and achievable

## Alignment

- [ ] Objectives align with chapter content
- [ ] Number of objectives is appropriate (3-5 per chapter typically)
- [ ] Objectives build on previous chapters
- [ ] Objectives contribute to book-level learning goals

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Prerequisites for each objective are clear
- [ ] Previous knowledge required is stated
- [ ] Dependencies on prior chapters are explicit
- [ ] External knowledge is identified

## Difficulty Level

- [ ] Difficulty is appropriate for target audience
- [ ] Progression from simple to complex is logical
- [ ] No sudden jumps in complexity
- [ ] Scaffolding supports achieving objectives

## Examples of Good vs Bad

**❌ Bad Objectives:**

- "Understand databases" (vague, not measurable)
- "Learn about authentication" (passive, no action verb)
- "Know React hooks" (not specific, not measurable)

**✅ Good Objectives:**

- "Implement JWT authentication in an Express.js REST API"
- "Analyze database query performance using EXPLAIN"
- "Design reusable React hooks for form state management"
