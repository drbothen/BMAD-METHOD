# Section Plan Checklist

Use this checklist to validate individual section plans before development. Prevents scope creep and ensures clear, focused sections.

## Section Focus

- [ ] Section has single clear focus
- [ ] Section title is descriptive
- [ ] 1-2 learning objectives (not more)
- [ ] Scope is achievable in 2-5 pages
- [ ] No scope creep

## Learning Objectives

- [ ] Objectives are specific and measurable
- [ ] Objectives use action verbs (implement, analyze, debug)
- [ ] Objectives align with chapter objectives
- [ ] Success criteria defined

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Prerequisites clearly stated
- [ ] Prerequisites from earlier sections referenced
- [ ] No assumed knowledge gaps

## Content Plan

- [ ] Concept explanation planned
- [ ] Tutorial walkthrough planned
- [ ] Practical applications planned
- [ ] Structure follows tutorial-section-tmpl.yaml

## Code Examples

- [ ] Number of code examples specified (1-3 typical)
- [ ] Example topics identified
- [ ] Code complexity appropriate
- [ ] Expected outputs documented
- [ ] Test approach defined

## Length and Scope

- [ ] Target length: 2-5 pages
- [ ] Not too short (< 2 pages)
- [ ] Not too long (> 5 pages - split if needed)
- [ ] Realistic time estimate (3-6 hours development)

## Transitions

- [ ] Connection to previous section planned
- [ ] Preview of next section considered
- [ ] Builds on chapter narrative

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Clear definition of "done"
- [ ] Quality checkpoints identified
- [ ] Review criteria specified

## Usage

- **When to use**: After section planning, before section development
- **Who executes**: Tutorial architect
- **Integration**: Use with execute-checklist task in section-planning-workflow (step 5)
- **On failure**: Refine section plan - adjust scope, clarify objectives, or split into multiple sections
