# Diagram Clarity Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure technical diagrams are clear, professional, and accessible.

## Purpose and Context

- [ ] Diagram has a clear, specific purpose
- [ ] Diagram supports and clarifies text explanation
- [ ] Context is provided (chapter/section where it appears)
- [ ] Diagram number and caption are descriptive
- [ ] Purpose is understandable at a glance

## Visual Clarity

- [ ] Labels are legible (minimum 10-12pt font)
- [ ] Text is readable in both print and digital formats
- [ ] Color contrast meets accessibility standards (WCAG AA: 4.5:1)
- [ ] Diagram works in grayscale (color not required to understand)
- [ ] No overlapping labels or elements
- [ ] White space used effectively (not overcrowded)

## Diagram Type

- [ ] Appropriate diagram type chosen for the concept
- [ ] Follows standard conventions for this diagram type
- [ ] Flow direction is natural (left-to-right or top-to-bottom)
- [ ] Symbols and shapes are conventional and recognizable
- [ ] Complexity is appropriate for target audience

## Content Completeness

- [ ] All key elements are present
- [ ] No extraneous elements that don't serve purpose
- [ ] Relationships and flows are clearly shown
- [ ] Decision points are marked (if applicable)
- [ ] Start and end points are obvious
- [ ] Legend provided if special symbols used

## Annotations and Labels

- [ ] All elements are labeled clearly
- [ ] Labels are concise (2-4 words maximum)
- [ ] Edge labels indicate what's flowing (data type, protocol, etc.)
- [ ] Callout boxes used for additional notes
- [ ] Step numbers present for sequential processes
- [ ] No spelling or grammatical errors in labels

## Style and Consistency

- [ ] Style is consistent with other book diagrams
- [ ] Color scheme is consistent
- [ ] Font family and size consistent
- [ ] Line styles have consistent meaning (solid vs. dashed)
- [ ] Shape conventions followed (rectangles for processes, etc.)
- [ ] Professional appearance (not hand-drawn unless intentional)

## Technical Quality

- [ ] High-resolution source available (300 DPI for print)
- [ ] Vector format preferred (SVG, PDF) or high-res raster
- [ ] File size is reasonable (<5 MB)
- [ ] Renders correctly in target formats (PDF, EPUB, print)
- [ ] No pixelation or blurriness
- [ ] Images are embedded or properly referenced

## Accessibility

- [ ] Alternative text (alt text) provided
- [ ] Alt text describes diagram purpose and flow
- [ ] Color is not the only way to convey information
- [ ] Sufficient color contrast for colorblind readers
- [ ] Text-based description available if diagram is complex
- [ ] Screen reader-friendly

## Integration with Text

- [ ] Diagram referenced in body text ("see Figure 3.2")
- [ ] Text explanation mentions key elements shown in diagram
- [ ] Diagram placement is near related text
- [ ] Caption provides context without repeating text verbatim
- [ ] Diagram reinforces concepts explained in text

## Educational Effectiveness

- [ ] Diagram clarifies a concept that's hard to explain in text alone
- [ ] Complexity is appropriate for learning stage
- [ ] Mental model is clear and accurate
- [ ] Diagram supports stated learning objectives
- [ ] Readers can reference diagram while reading text
