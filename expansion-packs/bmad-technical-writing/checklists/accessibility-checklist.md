- [ ] Reading order is logical for screen readers

## Code Examples

- [ ] Code examples can be read by screen readers
- [ ] Syntax highlighting doesn't rely on color alone
- [ ] Code comments supplement visual indentation
- [ ] Variable names are descriptive (not relying on visual context)

## Links and References

- [ ] Link text is descriptive ("Download Python installer" not "click here")
- [ ] URLs spelled out where context is important

- [ ] Link purpose can be determined from link text alone

## Tables

- [ ] Table headers clearly defined
- [ ] Complex tables have caption or summary
- [ ] Table structure is logical for linear reading
- [ ] Data tables use proper markup (not just visual formatting)
- [ ] Row and column headers associated with data cells

## Language and Readability

- [ ] Plain language used where possible (avoid unnecessary jargon)
- [ ] Acronyms defined on first use
- [ ] Technical terms explained when introduced
- [ ] Sentences are clear and concise
- [ ] Passive voice minimized
- [ ] Reading level appropriate for audience

## Navigation and Structure

- [ ] Chapter and section titles are descriptive
- [ ] Table of contents provides clear navigation
- [ ] Page numbers referenced where appropriate
- [ ] Consistent structure across chapters

## Multimedia Content

- [ ] Videos include captions or transcripts
- [ ] Audio content has text alternative
- [ ] Interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- [ ] Animation can be paused or stopped
- [ ] No flashing content (seizure risk)

## Mathematical and Scientific Notation

- [ ] Equations have text descriptions
- [ ] Mathematical symbols explained in text
- [ ] Formulas can be understood without seeing visual layout
- [ ] Alternative representations provided where helpful
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility considered

## PDF and Electronic Formats

- [ ] PDF is tagged for accessibility (if applicable)
- [ ] Text can be selected and copied
- [ ] Document properties set correctly
- [ ] Bookmarks or navigation included

## Testing and Validation

- [ ] Content tested with screen reader (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- [ ] Keyboard-only navigation tested
- [ ] Content tested at different zoom levels
- [ ] Automatic accessibility checker used
- [ ] Manual review by accessibility expert (if possible)

## Best Practices

- [ ] WCAG guidelines considered (AA level minimum)
- [ ] Accessibility is built-in, not retrofitted
- [ ] Multiple ways to access information provided
- [ ] User choice and customization supported
- [ ] Inclusive examples and scenarios used
