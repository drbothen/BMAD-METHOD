# Book Outline Checklist

Use this checklist to validate book outlines before beginning chapter development. Catching structural issues early prevents costly rewrites later.

## Scope and Structure

- [ ] Book scope is clearly defined and achievable
- [ ] Target page count is realistic (150-500 pages typical)
- [ ] Parts/chapters are organized logically
- [ ] 10-20 chapters typical (not too few, not too many)
- [ ] Part divisions make sense (if used)

## Audience and Prerequisites

- [ ] Target audience is clearly defined
- [ ] Reader prerequisites are stated
- [ ] Skill level is appropriate (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
- [ ] No assumed knowledge gaps

## Learning Flow

- [ ] Chapters progress from simple to complex
- [ ] Prerequisites are satisfied before concepts introduced
- [ ] Each chapter builds on previous chapters
- [ ] No circular dependencies
- [ ] Clear learning path from beginning to end

## Content Coverage

- [ ] All essential topics covered
- [ ] No major gaps in coverage
- [ ] Topics have appropriate depth
- [ ] Advanced topics saved for later chapters
- [ ] Book delivers on title/promise

## Chapter Balance

- [ ] Chapters are roughly similar length
- [ ] No chapters too short (< 10 pages) or too long (> 30 pages)
- [ ] Workload distributed evenly
- [ ] Each chapter has clear focus

## Learning Objectives

- [ ] Book-level learning objectives defined
- [ ] Chapter objectives align with book objectives
- [ ] Objectives are measurable and achievable
- [ ] Each chapter has 2-4 learning objectives

## Practical Application

- [ ] Hands-on exercises included
- [ ] Real-world examples planned
- [ ] Project work included (if applicable)
- [ ] Reader can apply knowledge after each chapter

## Usage

- **When to use**: After creating book outline, before chapter development
- **Who executes**: Instructional designer + tutorial architect
- **Integration**: Use with execute-checklist task from bmad-core
- **On failure**: Revise book outline to address failed items before proceeding
