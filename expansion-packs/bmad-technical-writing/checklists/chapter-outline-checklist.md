# Chapter Outline Checklist

Use this checklist to validate chapter outlines before section planning or writing begins. Ensures solid chapter structure before detailed development work.

## Chapter Structure

- [ ] Clear chapter title (descriptive, concise)
- [ ] Chapter introduction planned
- [ ] 5-8 sections outlined (not too few, not too many)
- [ ] Section titles are clear and descriptive
- [ ] Chapter summary/conclusion planned
- [ ] Logical flow from intro → sections → conclusion

## Learning Objectives

- [ ] 2-4 learning objectives defined (not too many)
- [ ] Objectives use Bloom's taxonomy verbs
- [ ] Objectives are measurable
- [ ] Objectives achievable within chapter
- [ ] Content plan supports objectives

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Prerequisites clearly stated
- [ ] Prerequisites satisfied by previous chapters
- [ ] No circular dependencies
- [ ] Assumed knowledge is appropriate

## Content Planning

- [ ] Key concepts identified
- [ ] Code examples planned (number and topics)
- [ ] Diagrams/screenshots identified
- [ ] Exercises/challenges planned
- [ ] Target length estimated (15-25 pages typical)

## Development Approach

- [ ] Section-driven vs traditional approach chosen
- [ ] If section-driven: 5-8 sections planned (2-5 pages each)
- [ ] If traditional: Content blocks outlined
- [ ] Complexity progression planned (simple → complex)

## Code Examples

- [ ] Number of code examples appropriate (3-8 typical)
- [ ] Example progression logical
- [ ] Examples demonstrate learning objectives
- [ ] Example complexity appropriate
- [ ] Test strategy identified

## Integration

- [ ] Chapter fits in book outline
- [ ] Builds on previous chapters
- [ ] Sets up future chapters
- [ ] No redundancy with other chapters

## Usage

- **When to use**: After creating chapter outline, before section planning or writing
- **Who executes**: Tutorial architect + instructional designer
- **Integration**: Use with execute-checklist task; validates chapter-outline.md before proceeding
- **On failure**: Refine chapter structure to address gaps before development
