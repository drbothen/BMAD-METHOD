Use this checklist to validate completed sections before marking them DONE. Ensures individual section quality in section-driven development.

## Length and Structure

- [ ] Section is 2-5 pages (not too short or long)
- [ ] Has introduction paragraph
- [ ] Has concept explanation section
- [ ] Has tutorial walkthrough section
- [ ] Has practical applications section
- [ ] Has transitions (to previous and next)

## Learning Objectives

- [ ] All section objectives addressed
- [ ] Content supports objectives
- [ ] Examples demonstrate objectives
- [ ] Practice opportunities provided

## Code Integration

- [ ] All planned code examples included
- [ ] Code is explained inline (not just shown)
- [ ] Expected outputs documented
- [ ] Code examples work as written
- [ ] Code follows best practices

## Tutorial Quality

- [ ] Step-by-step instructions clear
- [ ] Each step has explanation
- [ ] Reader can follow along
- [ ] Troubleshooting guidance provided
- [ ] No assumed steps

## Transitions

- [ ] References prerequisite concepts
- [ ] Connects to previous section
- [ ] Previews next section (if applicable)
- [ ] Maintains narrative flow

## Technical Accuracy

- [ ] Code examples tested
- [ ] Technical details correct
- [ ] Best practices followed
- [ ] No deprecated approaches

## Readability

- [ ] Clear and concise writing
- [ ] No jargon without explanation
- [ ] Active voice used
- [ ] Consistent terminology

## Success Criteria Met

- [ ] All success criteria from section plan achieved
- [ ] Section achieves learning objectives
- [ ] Quality meets chapter standards
- [ ] Ready for review

## Usage

- **When to use**: Before marking section as DONE in section-development-workflow (step 6)
- **Who executes**: Tutorial architect (self-check before review)
- **Integration**: Final quality gate in section-development-workflow
- **On failure**: Revise section content, add missing elements, or improve quality before proceeding
- **Note**: This validates individual sections, not entire chapters (use chapter-completeness-checklist for that)
