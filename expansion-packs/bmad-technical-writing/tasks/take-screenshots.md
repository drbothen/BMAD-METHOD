## Purpose

Create professional, readable screenshots that enhance understanding. Quality screenshots are essential for UI documentation, tutorials, and step-by-step guides.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Prepare Clean Environment

Set up for capture:

- Use clean desktop (no personal info)
- Close unnecessary windows
- Use default theme unless demonstrating customization
- Zoom to appropriate level (125-150% for clarity)
- Use realistic but safe demo data

### 2. Capture at High Resolution

Quality requirements:

- **Minimum 300 DPI** for print
- **Retina/HiDPI** for web (2x resolution)
- **Full window** vs **focused area** based on context
- **Consistent dimensions** for similar screenshots

### 3. Annotate Effectively

Add helpful annotations:

- **Arrows**: Point to specific UI elements
- **Numbered callouts**: Reference in text
- **Highlights**: Draw attention to key areas
- **Red boxes**: Emphasize important elements

### 4. Apply Consistent Styling

Visual consistency:

- Same annotation colors across book
- Consistent border/shadow treatment
- Uniform font for labels
- Matching screenshot dimensions for similar content

### 5. Name Files Descriptively

File naming convention:

```
chapter-02-django-admin-login.png
chapter-03-api-response-json.png
chapter-05-error-message-detail.png
```
