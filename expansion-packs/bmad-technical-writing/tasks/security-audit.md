## Purpose

This task guides you through performing a comprehensive security audit of code examples to identify vulnerabilities, security anti-patterns, and risks. Technical books must demonstrate secure coding practices, so thorough security review is critical.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this task:

- Code examples have been created and are working
- Target programming language(s) identified
- Security scanning tools available for target language(s)
- Access to security-best-practices-checklist.md
- Understanding of OWASP Top 10 and common vulnerabilities

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Identify Code Scope and Language

Define what will be audited:

**Code Inventory:**

- List all code files to audit
- Identify programming language(s) and frameworks
- Note any third-party dependencies
- Identify code that handles sensitive data
- Flag code with authentication/authorization
- Identify code with user input handling

**Risk Assessment:**

- High risk: Authentication, authorization, data storage, user input
- Medium risk: API calls, file operations, database queries
- Low risk: Pure logic, calculations, data transformations

### 2. Set Up Security Scanning Tools

Install appropriate tools for the language:

**JavaScript/Node.js:**

```bash
# Install npm audit (built-in)
npm audit

# Install eslint-plugin-security
npm install --save-dev eslint-plugin-security

# Install OWASP Dependency-Check
npm install -g retire.js
```

**Python:**

```bash
# Install Bandit (security linter)
pip install bandit

# Install Safety (dependency checker)
pip install safety

# Install Semgrep (pattern-based scanner)
pip install semgrep
```

**Ruby:**

```bash
# Install Brakeman (Rails security scanner)
gem install brakeman

# Install bundler-audit (dependency checker)
gem install bundler-audit
```

**Go:**

```bash
# Install gosec (security scanner)
go install github.com/securego/gosec/v2/cmd/gosec@latest

# Install Nancy (dependency checker)
go install github.com/sonatype-nexus-community/nancy@latest
```

**Java:**

```bash
# Install SpotBugs with FindSecBugs plugin

```

### 3. Run Automated Security Scanners

Execute automated tools:

**Step 1: Dependency Vulnerability Scanning**

Check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies:

```bash
# Node.js
npm audit
retire --path ./

# Python
safety check
pip-audit

# Ruby
bundle-audit check --update

# Go
nancy sleuth

# Rust
cargo audit
```

**Step 2: Static Code Analysis**

Scan code for security issues:

```bash
# Node.js
eslint --plugin security .
npm run lint:security  # if configured

# Python
bandit -r ./src
semgrep --config=auto .

# Ruby
brakeman --path .

# Go
gosec ./...

# Java
# Run SpotBugs/FindSecBugs in Maven/Gradle

# C#
security-scan analyze

# Rust
cargo clippy -- -W clippy::all
```

**Step 3: Document Scanner Output**

Capture all findings:

- Save scanner output to files
- Note severity levels from tools
- Identify false positives
- Prioritize findings for review

### 4. Perform Manual Security Review

Conduct manual code review using security-best-practices-checklist.md:

### 9. Troubleshooting Common Issues

**False Positives:**

- Automated scanners may flag safe code
- Document why flagged code is actually safe
- Update scanner configuration if possible
- Add code comments explaining safety

**Tool Installation Issues:**

- Check language/runtime version compatibility
- Use virtual environments/containers
- Refer to tool documentation
- Try alternative tools if installation fails

**No Baseline for Comparison:**

- On first audit, everything is new
- Document current state as baseline
- Future audits compare against baseline
- Track security debt over time

**Dependency Conflicts:**

- Security scanner dependencies may conflict
- Use separate virtual environments per tool
- Consider containerized scanning approach
- Document any tool limitations

**Language-Specific Challenges:**

_JavaScript:_

- Large dependency trees create noise
- Focus on direct dependencies first
- Use `npm audit --production` for prod deps only

_Python:_

- Virtual environment setup crucial
- Bandit may have false positives on test code
- Use `# nosec` comments judiciously with explanation

_Ruby:_

- Brakeman is Rails-specific
- Use standard Ruby scanners for non-Rails code

_Go:_

- gosec sometimes flags safe uses of crypto/rand
- Review findings in context

_Java:_

- Tool configuration can be complex
- May need to adjust Maven/Gradle settings

### 10. Remediate and Retest

For each vulnerability:

**Remediation Process:**

1. Understand the vulnerability thoroughly
2. Research secure alternative approaches
3. Implement fix or update documentation
4. Test fix doesn't break functionality
5. Rerun security scan to verify fix
6. Update audit report status
7. Document fix in code comments if needed

**Verification:**

- Rerun all scanners after fixes
- Verify vulnerability no longer detected
- Check fix doesn't introduce new issues
- Update security audit report

## Success Criteria

A complete security audit has:

- [ ] All code files identified and scanned
- [ ] Automated security scanners run successfully
- [ ] Manual security review completed
- [ ] security-best-practices-checklist.md completed
- [ ] All findings documented with severity levels
- [ ] Remediation guidance provided for each issue
- [ ] Security audit report generated
- [ ] Critical and High issues resolved or documented
- [ ] Code safe for publication

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Relying only on automated tools**: Manual review is essential
- **Ignoring false positives**: Document why flagged code is safe
- **Not testing security fixes**: Ensure fixes work and don't break code
- **Missing dependency vulnerabilities**: Always check dependencies
- **Ignoring language-specific risks**: Each language has unique patterns
- **No severity classification**: Not all issues are equal
- **Poor documentation**: Future reviewers need context
- **Not updating checklists**: Security standards evolve
- **Publishing with critical issues**: Never acceptable
- **No retest after fixes**: Verify remediation worked
