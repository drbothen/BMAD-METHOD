## Purpose

Create practice exercises that reinforce learning, assess comprehension, and build confidence through progressive difficulty. Effective exercises bridge theory and independent application.

## Prerequisites

- Chapter learning objectives defined
- Chapter content drafted or outlined
- Understanding of target audience skill level
- Access to learning-frameworks.md knowledge base

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Identify Learning Objectives to Assess

Map exercises to specific learning goals:

**For Each Learning Objective:**

- Which exercises will assess this?
- What demonstrates mastery?
- How can students practice this skill?

**Example Mapping:**

```
Objective: "Implement JWT authentication"
→ Exercise 2: Build login endpoint (basic)
→ Exercise 4: Add token refresh (intermediate)
→ Exercise 6: Implement role-based access (advanced)
```

**Coverage:**

- Each objective addressed by at least one exercise
- Core objectives get multiple exercises
- Progressive difficulty across related exercises

### 2. Determine Difficulty Levels

Plan difficulty range appropriate for chapter:

**Basic (⭐):**

- Direct application of chapter examples
- Clear guidance and hints
- Builds confidence
- 2-3 exercises per chapter

**Intermediate (⭐⭐):**

- Combines multiple concepts
- Requires problem-solving
- Less hand-holding
- 1-2 exercises per chapter

**Advanced (⭐⭐⭐):**

- Creative application
- Minimal guidance
- Extension of concepts
- 1 exercise per chapter (optional)

**Balance:** Most students should complete basic and intermediate exercises successfully.

### 3. Create 4-6 Exercises with Progressive Difficulty

Design exercise sequence:

**Exercise Structure:**

**Exercise Header:**

- Number and title
- Difficulty indicator (⭐ ⭐⭐ ⭐⭐⭐)
- Estimated time
- Learning objective addressed

**Problem Description:**

- Clear problem statement
- Specific requirements (numbered list)
- Input/output examples
- Success criteria

**Example:**

````
### Exercise 3: User Input Validation ⭐⭐
**Estimated Time:** 20 minutes
**Learning Objective:** Apply regex for validation

**Problem:**
Create a `validate_user_input()` function that validates user registration data:

Requirements:
1. Username: 3-20 characters, alphanumeric only
2. Email: Valid email format
3. Password: Minimum 8 characters, must include number and special character
4. Return dict with validation results for each field

**Test Cases:**
```python
validate_user_input("user123", "user@example.com", "Pass123!")
# Returns: {"username": True, "email": True, "password": True, "valid": True}

validate_user_input("ab", "invalid", "weak")
# Returns: {"username": False, "email": False, "password": False, "valid": False}
````

**Success Criteria:**

- All test cases pass
- Clear error messages for invalid inputs
- Uses regex for email validation

````

### 4. Write Clear Instructions

Make requirements explicit and unambiguous:

**Good Exercise Instructions:**
- State exact functionality needed
- Provide function signature or class structure
- List all requirements as numbered points
- Include test cases with expected results
- Specify any constraints

**Avoid:**
- Vague requirements ("make it work better")
- Ambiguous success criteria
- Assuming implied requirements
- Unclear edge cases

**Starter Code (for basic exercises):**
```python
def validate_user_input(username, email, password):
    """
    Validate user registration inputs.

    Args:
        username (str): Username to validate
        email (str): Email address to validate
        password (str): Password to validate

    Returns:
        dict: Validation results for each field and overall validity
    """
    # Your code here
    pass
````

### 5. Develop Solution Approaches

Provide guidance without giving away the answer:

**Solution Approach (Not Full Code):**

- High-level algorithm
- Key concepts to apply
- Recommended data structures
- Common pitfalls to avoid

**Example:**

```
**Solution Approach:**
1. Create validation functions for each field type
2. Use regex pattern for email: `^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$`
3. For password, check length first, then regex for number and special char
4. Return dictionary with results for each field
5. Set `valid` to True only if all fields pass

**Key Concepts:**
- Python `re` module for regex matching
- `re.match()` vs `re.fullmatch()` - use fullmatch for exact pattern matching
- Combining multiple validation conditions

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Forgetting to anchor regex with ^ and $
- Not handling empty string inputs
- Allowing spaces in username
```

**Balance:** Enough guidance to unstick students, not so much they don't think.

### 6. Add Progressive Hints

Create hints that reveal information gradually:

**Hint Structure:**

- Hint 1: General approach or concept
- Hint 2: More specific technique
- Hint 3: Nearly complete solution approach

**Example:**

```
**Hints:**
1. Break the problem into three separate validation functions
2. Use Python's `re` module - import with `import re`
3. For password validation, you can use multiple regex patterns:
   - `re.search(r'\d', password)` to check for digit
   - `re.search(r'[!@#$%^&*]', password)` for special char
```

**Good Hints:**

- Guide thinking, don't solve the problem
- Progressive reveal (start general)
- Specific to common sticking points
- Teach concepts, not just answer

### 7. Create Extension Challenges

Add optional advanced problems:

**Extension Characteristics:**

- Builds on basic exercise
- Requires creative thinking
- No hints provided
- Tests deeper mastery

**Example Extensions:**

````
**Extension Challenges:**

**Challenge 1: Password Strength Meter**
Enhance the password validator to return a strength score (1-5) based on:
- Length (longer = stronger)
- Character variety (lowercase, uppercase, numbers, special chars)
- Common password detection

**Challenge 2: Custom Validation Rules**
Allow configuration of validation rules via a config object:
```python
rules = {
    "username": {"min": 3, "max": 20, "pattern": r"^[a-z0-9_]+$"},
    "password": {"min": 12, "require_special": True, "require_number": True}
}
validate_with_rules(data, rules)
````

```

**Purpose:** Challenges extend learning for students who want more practice.

### 8. Estimate Completion Time

Provide realistic time estimates:

**Factors:**
- Problem complexity
- Amount of code to write
- Testing and debugging time
- Student skill level

**Basic Exercise:** 10-20 minutes
**Intermediate:** 20-40 minutes
**Advanced:** 40-90 minutes

**Test Your Estimate:**
- Time yourself solving it
- Add 50-100% for students (you're expert)
- Test with actual students if possible

**State in Exercise:**
```

**Estimated Time:** 25 minutes

This includes:

- Understanding requirements: 5 min
- Implementation: 15 min
- Testing: 5 min

```

### 9. Validate Exercises Are Solvable

Quality check all exercises:

**Self-Solve:**
- Solve each exercise yourself without looking at hints
- Note any ambiguities or unclear requirements
- Verify time estimate is reasonable
- Ensure you only use concepts from the chapter

**Peer Review:**
- Have colleague attempt exercises
- Observe where they get stuck
- Note questions they ask
- Improve instructions based on feedback

**Verification:**
- All test cases provided are correct
- Multiple valid solutions exist (usually)
- Success criteria are measurable
- Difficulty matches rating

**Use:** exercise-difficulty-checklist.md

### 10. Run Quality Checklist

Final validation:

**Execute:** exercise-difficulty-checklist.md

**Check:**
- Progressive difficulty across exercises
- Each learning objective assessed
- Clear, unambiguous instructions
- Appropriate hints provided
- Time estimates realistic
- Exercises solvable with chapter knowledge
- No prerequisites beyond chapter scope

## Output

Exercise set should include:

- 4-6 exercises with progressive difficulty
- Clear problem statements
- Test cases and success criteria
- Progressive hints
- Solution approaches
- Extension challenges
- Estimated completion times
- Self-assessment checklist

**Use template:** exercise-set-tmpl.yaml
