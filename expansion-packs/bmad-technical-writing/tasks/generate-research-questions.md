[Architecture, components, performance, security questions]

## Practical Application Questions (6-10 questions)

[Use cases, implementation, best practices, testing questions]

## Advanced Topics Questions (3-6 questions)

[Limitations, scaling, advanced techniques, integration questions]

## Troubleshooting Questions (3-5 questions)

[Errors, debugging, tools, operations questions]
```

**Sequence within categories:**

**Aim for 20-30 total questions**

### 9. Refine Questions

Make questions specific and answerable:

**Bad question (too vague):**

**Good question (specific):**

- "How does React's virtual DOM reconciliation algorithm work?"

**Bad question (too broad):**

- "What are best practices?"

**Good question (specific):**

- "What are best practices for managing state in React applications?"

**Refinement checklist for each question:**

- [ ] Is it specific enough to research?
- [ ] Is it answerable (not purely opinion)?
- [ ] Is it relevant to the topic?
- [ ] Is it at appropriate depth for audience?
- [ ] Does it add unique value (not duplicate)?

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Too few questions**: Missing important aspects
- **Too many questions**: Overwhelming, redundant
- **Too vague**: "How does it work?" vs "How does [specific component] work?"
- **Too broad**: "Best practices?" vs "Best practices for [specific use case]?"
- **Only surface-level**: Need deep-dive questions too
- **Only advanced**: Need foundational questions
- **Unanswerable**: Opinion-based or too speculative
- **No organization**: Random list is hard to work with
- **Duplicates**: Same question asked multiple ways
- **Off-topic**: Questions not relevant to research goal

## Next Steps

After generating research questions:

1. Review questions with technical expert or co-author
2. Prioritize questions (critical vs nice-to-know)
3. Use research-technical-topic.md to systematically answer questions
4. Document sources and findings
5. Synthesize research into content outline
