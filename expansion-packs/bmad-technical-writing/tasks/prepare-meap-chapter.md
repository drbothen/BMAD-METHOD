## Purpose

Prepare a chapter for early release through Manning's MEAP program, ensuring it provides value to early readers even before the complete book is finished.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Make Chapter Standalone

Provide necessary context:

**Add Chapter Introduction:**
```
This chapter covers [topic]. In the previous chapter, you learned [previous topic brief summary].
In this chapter, you'll discover [current topic]. By the end, you'll be able to [learning outcomes].

Note: This is an early access chapter. Some cross-references to future chapters are placeholders.
```

### 2. No Forward References

Avoid referencing unreleased content:

```
‚ùå "As we'll see in Chapter 8..."
‚úÖ "In a future chapter on deployment..."

‚ùå "See Section 7.3 for details"
‚úÖ "This will be covered in detail in the final book"
```

### 3. Link Code Repository

Make code easily accessible:

```
Code Examples

All code for this chapter is available at:
https://github.com/username/book-code/tree/main/chapter-05

Download: [Download ZIP button/link]
```

### 4. Add "What's Coming Next"

Preview future content:

```
## Coming in Future Chapters

In the next chapter, you'll learn about:
- Topic 1
- Topic 2
- Topic 3

Future chapters will cover:
- Advanced patterns (Chapter 7)
- Production deployment (Chapter 9)
- Performance optimization (Chapter 10)
```

Set expectations:

```
üìò MEAP Early Access Notice

This is an early access chapter. You may encounter:
- Placeholders for future cross-references
- Draft diagrams or images
- Sections marked [TBD]

Your feedback helps shape the final book! Please share thoughts at:
