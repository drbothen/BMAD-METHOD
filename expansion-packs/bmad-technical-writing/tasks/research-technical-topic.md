## Purpose

This task provides a systematic workflow for researching technical topics with proper source tracking. Instead of scattered research, you'll create organized, well-sourced notes that can be synthesized into high-quality content.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this task:

- Research questions list (from generate-research-questions.md task)
- Access to research tools (web browser, AI tools like Perplexity/ChatGPT, documentation)
- Clear research goal (chapter, section, article)
- Time allocation (estimate 2-4 hours for comprehensive research)

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Organize Research Questions

Structure your research approach:

**Review question list:**
- Total questions to answer
- Categories (foundational, technical, practical, advanced, troubleshooting)
- Estimated effort per question

**Prioritize questions:**

**Critical (must answer):**
- Core to understanding topic
- Necessary for target content
- Foundational knowledge

**Important (should answer):**
- Enhances understanding significantly
- Best practices and patterns
- Common use cases

**Optional (nice to answer):**
- Advanced topics
- Edge cases
- Bonus content

**Identify dependencies:**
- Which questions should be answered first?
- Do some questions inform others?
- What's the logical research sequence?

**Create research plan:**

```markdown
## Research Plan: [Topic]

**Time Budget**: 3 hours
**Priority**: Critical questions first, then important, then optional

### Phase 1: Foundational (30 min, 7 questions)
- Question 1 (critical)

### 3. Systematic Research Process (Per Question)

For each question, follow this workflow:

#### Step 1: State the Question Clearly

```markdown
## Question 1: What is JWT and how does it differ from session-based authentication?

**Category**: Foundational
**Priority**: Critical
**Estimated Time**: 15 minutes
**Status**: In Progress
```

#### Step 2: Search for Answers

**Search strategy:**

1. Start with official documentation
   - Google: "[topic] official documentation"
   - Visit official website/docs

2. Check authoritative sources
   - RFCs, specifications if applicable
   - Established technical resources (MDN, etc.)

3. Supplement with secondary sources
   - Technical blogs from reputable companies
   - Stack Overflow top answers
   - Relevant books/courses

4. Use AI tools for synthesis
   - Perplexity AI with "Find sources" mode
   - ChatGPT/Claude for explanations (verify with sources)

#### Step 3: Evaluate Sources

**For each source, assess:**

- **Authority**: Who wrote this? Are they credible?
- **Currency**: When was this published? Is it up-to-date?
- **Accuracy**: Does it match other sources? Any red flags?
- **Coverage**: Does it answer the question fully?
- **Clarity**: Is the explanation understandable?

**Red flags:**
- Very old content (pre-2020 for fast-moving tech)
- No author attribution
- Conflicts with official docs
- Poor English/obvious errors
- No sources cited for claims

#### Step 4: Take Structured Notes

Use this format for each question:

```markdown
## Question 1: What is JWT and how does it differ from session-based authentication?

**Answer**:

JWT (JSON Web Token) is a stateless authentication mechanism where the server generates a signed token containing user information and sends it to the client. The client includes this token in subsequent requests. Unlike session-based auth where server stores session data, JWT is self-contained and the server validates the token signature without needing to look up session storage.

**Key Differences**:
- JWT: Stateless, token stored client-side, server validates signature
- Session: Stateful, session stored server-side, cookie contains session ID
- JWT: Better for distributed systems/microservices (no shared session store needed)
- Session: Easier to revoke access (delete server-side session)

**Sources**:

1. **JWT.io Introduction** (https://jwt.io/introduction)
   - Official JWT website
   - Explains structure (header.payload.signature)
   - Diagrams showing flow
   - Trust: High | Date: 2024

2. **RFC 7519 - JSON Web Token** (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519)
   - Official specification
   - Technical definition of JWT structure
   - Trust: Authoritative | Date: 2015 (stable spec)

3. **Auth0 Blog: JWT vs Sessions** (https://auth0.com/blog/jwt-vs-sessions/)
   - Comparison table
   - Real-world trade-offs
   - Security considerations
   - Trust: High (Auth0 is authority on auth) | Date: 2023

4. **Stack Overflow: JWT vs Session Cookies** (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43452896/)
   - Community discussion
   - Multiple perspectives
   - 450+ upvotes
   - Trust: Medium | Date: 2019 (check if still accurate)

**Key Takeaways**:
- JWT is stateless; session is stateful
- JWT better for distributed systems
- Sessions easier to revoke
- JWT requires careful security (HTTPS, secret management)
- Both have valid use cases

**Code Examples**:
(Will need to create example showing both approaches)

**Open Questions**:
- How do you handle JWT revocation? (Research in later question)
- What are specific security best practices? (Covered in security question)

**Confidence Level**: High (multiple authoritative sources agree)
```

#### Step 5: Document Code Examples

When you find code:

```markdown
**Code Example**: Basic JWT Generation (Node.js)

**Source**: JWT.io documentation

**Language**: JavaScript (Node.js)

**Dependencies**: jsonwebtoken package

**Code**:
\`\`\`javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

const token = jwt.sign(
  { userId: 123, email: 'user@example.com' },
  'your-secret-key',
  { expiresIn: '1h' }
);

console.log(token);
// eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
\`\`\`

**Notes**:
- Never hardcode secrets in production
- Token expires in 1 hour (expiresIn)
- Payload should not contain sensitive data (it's base64 encoded, not encrypted)

**Testing Status**: Not yet tested (will test in code example creation phase)

**Attribution**: https://jwt.io/introduction
```

#### Step 6: Note Conflicting Information

When sources disagree:

```markdown
**Conflicting Information Noted**:

**Question**: Should JWTs be stored in localStorage or cookies?

**Position A** (Source: Auth0 Blog):
- Use httpOnly cookies for better XSS protection
- LocalStorage vulnerable to XSS attacks
- Cookies auto-sent by browser (secure if configured correctly)

**Position B** (Source: Some Medium articles):
- Use localStorage for easier mobile app integration
- Cookies subject to CSRF (require CSRF tokens)
- LocalStorage gives more control

**Resolution**:
- Security best practice: httpOnly cookies (prevents XSS access)
- Trade-off: Cookies require CSRF protection
- Context matters: SPA vs traditional web app
- Recommendation: httpOnly cookies + SameSite attribute + CSRF tokens

**Confidence**: Medium (context-dependent, both approaches have merit)
```

### 4. Track Research Progress

Maintain a progress tracker:

**Create status document:**

```markdown
