# Formatting Humanization Patterns

## Overview

This knowledge base documents evidence-based research on how human writers differ from AI writers in their use of formatting elements (em-dashes, bolding, italics) in technical writing. Understanding these patterns enables content creators to produce authentically human-sounding technical documentation.

## Research Foundation

Based on comprehensive analysis of AI detection research, linguistic pattern studies, and professional technical writing standards, this guide identifies the distinctive formatting signatures that differentiate human-written from AI-generated content.

## Critical Formatting Patterns

### 1. The Em-Dash Problem ("ChatGPT Dash")

**AI Pattern:**
- GPT-4 uses em-dashes approximately **10x more frequently** than human writers
- Multiple em-dashes per paragraph is common
- Em-dashes appear with mechanical regularity throughout documents
- Statistical pattern emerged from training data bias toward older texts (1860s peak em-dash usage at 0.35% word frequency)

**Human Pattern:**
- **1-2 em-dashes per page maximum** in technical writing
- Em-dashes serve specific structural purposes:
  - Mark abrupt change in thought
  - Introduce explanation/example
  - Create emphasis through interruption
  - Set off parenthetical information
- Natural variation in punctuation choice (em-dash, semicolon, comma, period)

**The Substitution Test:**
For each em-dash, ask: "Could a period, semicolon, or comma work as well or better?"
- If YES → Use the alternative punctuation
- If NO → The em-dash is justified

**Practical Guideline:**
Limit em-dashes to 1-2 per page. When you find yourself using 3+ em-dashes on a page, restructure sentences or use alternative punctuation.

### 2. Bold Text Usage

**AI Pattern:**
- Mechanical consistency in bolding throughout document
- Excessive bolding creating visual noise
- Democratic regularity (similar elements all bolded regardless of importance)
- Formatting applied with statistical consistency, not contextual judgment

**Human Pattern:**
- **Purposeful inconsistency** - formatting varies based on communicative intent
- Selective bolding for truly critical information only:
  - UI elements requiring user action
  - Critical warnings or important notices
  - Key terms being defined (first use only)
  - Essential information readers must notice
- Uses **negative space** - some similar information deliberately left unbolded to signal relative importance
- Restraint principle: "Does this particular information need visual emphasis at this specific point?"

**Practical Guideline:**
- Bold only 2-5% of content
- Reserve bolding for genuinely critical elements
- Avoid bolding predictable patterns (e.g., every command name, every function name)
- Use bolding to create visual anchors for scanning, not decoration

### 3. Italic Text Usage

**AI Pattern:**
- Scattered italics appearing with predictable frequency
- Decorative rather than functional application
- Consistent density across document sections

**Human Pattern:**
- Functional application for specific categories:
  - Titles of publications/software
  - Uncommon terms being defined
  - Subtle emphasis on specific words (sparingly)
  - Foreign language expressions
- **Category consistency** - same types of elements receive italics throughout
- Avoids extended passages in italics (reduces readability)
- Restraint - italics for discrete elements only

**Practical Guideline:**
- Define 2-4 categories that receive italics (e.g., "publication titles" and "terms being defined")
- Apply italics consistently within those categories
- Avoid casual italicization for emphasis
- Never italicize multiple consecutive sentences

### 4. Formatting Distribution (Burstiness)

**AI Pattern:**
- **Low burstiness** - uniform formatting distribution
- Predictable pattern regularity
- Mathematical consistency in how formatting appears
- Same depth of formatting across all sections

**Human Pattern:**
- **High burstiness** - natural variation in formatting density
- Some sections have rich formatting, others minimal
- **Argumentative asymmetry** - more formatting for complex concepts, less for simple ones
- Contextual variation based on reader needs at each point

**Practical Guideline:**
- Vary formatting density across sections
- Heavy formatting where concepts are complex/critical
- Minimal formatting where content is straightforward
- Avoid creating predictable "every third paragraph has a bolded term" patterns

## Detection Science

### Perplexity and Formatting
- **Perplexity** measures how predictable text is to a language model
- AI formatting: Low perplexity (predictable patterns)
- Human formatting: Higher perplexity (context-dependent choices)

### Syntactic Templates
- AI reproduces learned grammatical structures with consistent formatting
- Humans vary punctuation even with similar sentence structures
- Example: AI might always use em-dash with "X — which means Y" pattern; humans vary between em-dash, colon, comma, or period

### Detection Metrics
- Token efficiency - formatting markers per semantic unit
- Rhetorical structure - hierarchical vs. mechanical formatting
- Stylistic memorization - reproduction of learned patterns

## Style Guide Principles

### Professional Standards
- **Chicago Manual of Style**: Em-dashes with purpose, cautions against overuse
- **APA Style**: Bold for headings, italics for titles and scientific terms
- **IEEE Style**: Clarity and consistency, specific technical templates

### Content Style Guide Best Practices
- Define WHY formatting is used, not just WHAT
- Provide examples of appropriate and inappropriate applications
- Emphasize that formatting should support, not replace, clear writing
- "Clarity over correctness" principle

## Formatting Authenticity Checklist

When reviewing content for formatting authenticity:

**Em-Dashes:**
- [ ] 1-2 per page maximum (or fewer)
- [ ] Each em-dash serves specific structural purpose
- [ ] Could alternative punctuation work equally well?
- [ ] No mechanical patterns of em-dash distribution

**Bold Text:**
- [ ] Reserved for truly critical information
- [ ] Purposeful inconsistency (not all similar elements bolded)
- [ ] Creates visual anchors without noise
- [ ] 2-5% of content bolded maximum

**Italics:**
- [ ] Applied to specific functional categories only
- [ ] Consistent within categories
- [ ] No extended passages in italics
- [ ] Functional, not decorative

**Overall Distribution:**
- [ ] Natural variation in formatting density across sections
- [ ] More formatting where concepts are complex
- [ ] Less formatting where content is straightforward
- [ ] No predictable mechanical patterns

## Common AI Formatting Tells

**Red Flags indicating AI-generated content:**
1. **3+ em-dashes per page** - Strongest signal
2. **Uniform bolding patterns** - Every function name bolded, every term bolded
3. **Predictable formatting rhythm** - Same visual pattern every N paragraphs
4. **Scattered italics** - Appears frequently without clear functional purpose
5. **Consistent formatting depth** - Same amount of formatting regardless of content complexity
6. **Formulaic transitions with em-dashes** - "Furthermore — ", "Moreover — ", "Additionally — "

## Humanization Strategies

### Immediate Fixes
1. **Em-dash audit** - Count per page, reduce to 1-2 maximum
2. **Substitution test** - Replace em-dashes with periods, commas, semicolons where appropriate
3. **Bold reduction** - Remove 50-70% of bolding, keep only critical elements
4. **Italic categorization** - Define categories, remove casual italics

### Deeper Strategies
1. **Purposeful inconsistency** - Vary which similar elements receive formatting
2. **Contextual judgment** - Ask "Does THIS need emphasis HERE?"
3. **Natural variation** - Create burstiness in formatting distribution
4. **Functional formatting** - Every formatting choice serves communication purpose

### Post-Generation Review
When reviewing AI-assisted content:
1. Count em-dashes per page
2. Test each em-dash for necessity
3. Audit bolding for purpose vs. decoration
4. Verify italics follow consistent functional categories
5. Check for predictable formatting patterns
6. Ensure formatting variation across sections

## Technical Writing Context

### When Formatting Recedes
Well-executed formatting becomes invisible because it **supports comprehension rather than distracting from it**. Readers should notice:
- The information (what's important)
- The structure (how ideas connect)
- The clarity (easy to understand)

Readers should NOT notice:
- The formatting itself
- Mechanical patterns
- Decorative emphasis

### The Purposefulness Principle
For every formatting decision, be able to answer:
- "Why does THIS element need emphasis?"
- "Why HERE in the document?"
- "How does this help the reader?"

If you cannot answer these questions, the formatting is probably unnecessary.

## Integration with Writing Workflow

### Pre-Writing
- Review tone specification for formality level
- Note which elements should receive consistent formatting
- Understand audience's scanning/reading patterns

### During Writing
- Apply formatting sparingly
- Use em-dashes only when other punctuation won't work
- Bold only genuinely critical information
- Vary formatting density based on content complexity

### Post-Writing Review
- Run em-dash count (target: 1-2 per page)
- Apply substitution test to each em-dash
- Audit bolding (remove 50%+ if excessive)
- Check for mechanical patterns
- Verify purposeful inconsistency exists

## Advanced Considerations

### Argumentative Asymmetry
Human writers devote more formatting attention to concepts they recognize as potentially confusing. This creates natural asymmetry:
- Complex sections: More bolding, clearer structure, careful punctuation
- Simple sections: Minimal formatting, straightforward prose

AI systems maintain more consistent depth across all elements.

### Voice Through Formatting
Authentic voice emerges when formatting reflects genuine engagement with subject matter and audience. Formatting choices signal:
- What the writer finds important
- Where the writer anticipates reader confusion
- How the writer structures their thinking

This authentic signaling cannot be mechanically reproduced.

### The Clarity Principle
When formatting choices conflict with style rules, **clarity wins**. The governing principle: Does this help the reader understand and navigate the content?

If formatting aids comprehension → Use it
If formatting merely decorates → Omit it
