PACKT Template Style List

This document contains a list of the styles in the Packt template, and
an indicator of their typical use. You can access these styles from the
**Quick Access Toolbar** in the **Home** tab:

Use these to apply appropriate styling to the content you are writing.

**Essential styles to use**

The Packt writing template features a large number of styles for
different kinds of content. These styles help make our final books
easier to follow. Most styles are not necessary during first drafts
although some authors like to apply them as they go. It's up to you.

Some styles are so important that it's worth using them even in the
first draft. These are:

Heading styles, which give overall structure to the document.

Code and Code Highlighted styles, which mean blocks of code are in a
fixed-width font.

The Layout Information styles, which are necessary for our internal
processes.

The Information Box style, which lets you share short blocks of text
separately from the main flow of the chapter -- or just make key points
stand out.

For numbered and bulleted lists you can either use the Packt styles or
the built-in list feature, whichever is easier for you. In the first
draft it's fine to use the built-in **bold** and _italic_ formats, but
in the final book we will replace these with the appropriate Packt
style.

You do not need to use any other styles in your first draft but you can
if you choose to. Bear in mind that any formatting you do will be
replaced with the appropriate Packt style later, so please do not
attempt any complex formatting as you write your chapter.

You'll see each style explained in more detail later in this document.

**How styles work**

In case you've not used styles much before, here's some background:

> Paragraph styles apply to the entire paragraph -- Character styles
> apply to individual words within a paragraph. To remove a Character
> style from your text, select the word and press _Ctrl+Space_ and the
> word will revert to the underlying paragraph style.
>
> Do not use blank lines as spacing between paragraphs. Spacing between
> different paragraphs and styles is taken care of by the template
> styles.
>
> OpenOffice users: The \[PACKT\] styles can be found in the style list
> by viewing the Custom Styles. However, the heading styles in your
> template do not show the \[PACKT\] suffix, and the ordinary heading
> styles, Heading 1, Heading 2, etc. are used. These do not show in the
> Custom Styles view unfortunately.
>
> If you wish to make notes for the editors, add a comment to the
> document using Word\'s comment feature or Open Office\'s notes
> feature.

**The Packt Styles**

Note that all of the styles are followed by the word \[PACKT\] in their
style name in the template.

> Styles other than the \[PACKT\] styles should not be used in your
> document without prior consultation with your editor. Do not manually
> change fonts and layout, please use the \[PACKT\] styles instead.
