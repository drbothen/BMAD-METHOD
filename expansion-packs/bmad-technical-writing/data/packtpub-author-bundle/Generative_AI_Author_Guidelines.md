# Generative AI – Guidance for Authors

**Source**: PacktPub Author Bundle - Official Guidelines

## Overview

As a publisher, we recognize that generative AI tools can assist you in researching and writing content. We also recognize, however, that there are risks associated with doing so, if generative AI use is not carefully assessed, monitored, and managed.

Significant and unchecked use of generative AI in a book can impact the legitimacy, reliability, and overall quality of content. This can lead to loss of reader trust, negative book reviews, poor book sales, and potentially even impact your status as an author. This guidance highlights some recent negative reviews related to AI-generated content. It also contains examples of AI-generated content so you can see the problems associated with this kind of material.

**If you are thinking about using generative AI to help you with your book, it's best we talk about it.** Reach out to us, let us know what you're thinking, and why, and we can discuss it and go from there. We are supportive of limited use of generative AI as a way to improve your own writing, but generative AI is not a replacement for your writing. It is your unique insights, expertise, and experience that matters. That is what the Packt brand stands for and the value readers want from you and the Packt brand.

## Guidelines around the use of generative AI tools

If you have to use generative AI, guidelines around its use include:

- **Always check AI-generated material for accuracy** – generative AI tools can be prone to errors and hallucinations and are likely not up to date.

- **Focus on value for the reader at all times** – AI-generated text can be repetitive and lack depth. As you work through your book, keep asking yourself, 'How much value will readers get from this?'; 'If I read this in a book I've purchased, would I be satisfied?'

- **Ensure your voice and experience shines** – AI-generated text is impersonal. Readers will be interested in your expertise, real-life experiences, and insights. Only you can provide that.

- **Aim for your content to be engaging** – AI-generated text can sound dry and artificial. You don't want readers to lose interest because they feel your book is boring!

- **Ensure your content is specific and relevant** – AI-generated text is generic. Material in your book should always retain the connection to the overall goal of the book, the individual chapter, the topic or task at hand, and the target audience you're aiming for.

- **Ensure the style, approach, and tone of your book is consistent throughout** – AI-generated text pasted carelessly, without editing or refinement, can be easy for readers to spot. Inconsistency of style and approach can also be confusing and distracting for readers.

- **Evaluate grammar correction** – generative AI can correct grammar, but this can also result in smoothed-out, impersonal text. Specialist tools such as Grammarly are still better for this use case. We use specialist human copy editors to correct grammar, so as long as your material is readable we can deal with any small errors without needing AI assistance. Again, talk to us if you want to use generative AI for language improvement and correction.

**We hold you, as the author, accountable for originality, validity, and integrity of the content of your work and we expect you to uphold publishing ethics.**

## Packt's stance on Generative AI use by authors

At Packt, we focus on publishing expert, human voices. Having said that, we accept that authors may use generative AI tools in a limited capacity to help them with their books.

### Transparency

We consider transparency around the use of generative AI essential, and that is why, if you choose to use generative AI at any point during the development of your book, **we require you to declare it to us**. We will need you to specify how and where you've used generative AI in your book. We in turn will declare this to readers through a disclaimer at the beginning of your book (see Integrity below).

This level of transparency is crucial and ensures that we can work together to create legitimate content that is valuable for our readers and competitive in its market. The more open you are about any use of generative AI, the quicker and smoother the development process of your book will be.

### Accountability

In line with the guidelines above, we also consider it vital that all use of generative AI has been carefully checked by you for accuracy and relevancy before you consider using it to help you with your book. This is to maintain accountability for the content that you publish.

### Integrity

We are completely honest with customers and partners about the extent to which we use AI to generate content. This will help protect your reputation, while also demonstrating that we are a company at the cutting edge of technology.

**With the risks of generative AI and our stance towards it in mind, Packt retains its discretion over the publication of work, to ensure that integrity and guidelines are upheld.**

## What do our readers think about AI-generated content?

This section demonstrates that readers do not like AI-generated content in our books. Sometimes this criticism is accurate (there is AI-generated content), other times it is perceived (the author wrote in a way that looks like AI-generated content). However, the sentiment is the same and we should avoid content that is and seems AI-generated.

### Reader Feedback Examples

- **Strict structure complaint**: Reader notes the strict structure that AI can follow if used in every chapter and why that's not useful
  - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1HOG4UKWG2HU9/

- **Common AI habits**: Reader points out common generative AI habits
  - https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ZJH3E2Y10K8W/

- **Confusing text**: Confusing text leads to suspicions of AI use. You can see how the reader expects clarity, whether the author used AI or not

- **Unnecessary content**: Unnecessary content leads the reader to suspect AI
  - https://www.amazon.de/gp/customer-reviews/R142E49G2W8G3O/

- **Engagement issues**: Reader tells us that reading AI-like content is not engaging
  - https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/RHZOWLBG7VSEL/

- **Usefulness concerns**: Review highlights that it doesn't matter who wrote the content, if it's AI-like, it's not useful or readable

## What does AI-generated content look like in our books?

This section will show some examples of what AI-generated content looks like when it's included in a long-form document such as a chapter or a book. You'll see why it has its limitations and why we encourage authors not to use generative AI to generate content.

### 1. Inaccurate information or hallucinations

One known limitation of generative AI is hallucinations. Below is one example where the author built their content with generative AI:

> "Case studies of prevented data breaches highlight the effectiveness of AI in real-world scenarios. For example, a financial institution implemented an AI-driven data loss prevention system that monitored employee activities and data transfers. The system detected an employee attempting to transfer sensitive customer information to a personal email account, blocked the transfer, and alerted security personnel, preventing a potential data breach."

**Problem**: This is so generic it's not useful to the reader. There is no citation or analysis. This is a common scenario with AI-generated content in chapter-length documents. Accurate technical information is what sets you apart as an expert author.

### 2. Similar content scattered across the chapter

Generative AI has a large context window, but still struggles to write coherently over long-form documents. They also lose context if asked to write separate sections in different prompts.

**Problem**: The generative AI had lost track of its context and generated repetitive material. Readers want practical, focused content from expert authors. They are spending hard-earned money on your book.

### 3. Irrelevant content

At times, generative AI provides content that is only vaguely related to the prompt, resulting in information overload.

**Problem**: Large paragraphs of filler that impart no actual knowledge. As noted in the reviews earlier, readers are sensitive to filler content like this. They feel it adds no value. It is this value that only you can add to a book.

### 4. Unconventional phrasing

Generative AI can tend towards over-writing and poor metaphors.

#### Over-writing

**Example**: Flowery and verbose descriptions

AI has provided an overblown description of the chapter's topic and the benefits to the reader.

**Common AI overused words/phrases**:
- "sophisticated" (appeared 36 times in one example chapter)
- Polysyllabic words when simple ones would be better

**Example from data science book**:
> "The profound efficacy of strategic planning in the domain of data analytics is most compellingly exemplified through narratives drawn from the empirical realm."

**Problem**: Use of fancy, polysyllabic words when simple ones would be better.

#### Metaphors

Generative AI tends to have two problems with metaphors: **overusing them** and **creating nonsense versions**.

**Problem 1 - Overuse**: Four metaphors in a single paragraph makes content particularly difficult to read. The metaphors are making this less clear, rather than more clear.

**Problem 2 - Nonsense metaphors**: Examples of nonsense metaphors that spread all over the paragraph, or generative AI trying to write a metaphor and completely failing.

## Conclusion

All of this demonstrates how using generative AI to generate content is not being an author. As an author, the reader wants your authentic, unique voice. Your editor can help you with this; we have many options to work on your writing to make it the best it can be.

**Key Takeaways**:
1. AI is a tool for improvement, not replacement
2. Your unique insights, expertise, and experience are what readers want
3. Always declare AI use to PacktPub
4. Check all AI-generated content for accuracy and relevance
5. Ensure your voice and experience shine through
