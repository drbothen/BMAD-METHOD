Author's Toolbox

Technical books are complex. A good technical book will be well
structured and use a variety of layout devices to present the
information in a way which aids comprehension. This chapter will
demonstrate these devices. You\'ll be able to drop them into your own
work in order to produce great content which readers will love.

This guide is designed explicitly to act as a sample chapter, and will
conform to the rules it sets.

We\'re going to cover the following topics:

- Writing an introductory paragraph

- General text style

- Headings

- Paragraphs

- Lists

- Code samples

- Box outs

- Images

# Writing an introductory paragraph

The overall point of an introduction is to make the reader understand
why they should read on. A good introduction:

- Is brief

- Relates the new topic to things the reader already knows

- Introduces the new topic/idea as a solution to a problem that the
  reader can understand

- Makes the reader understand why the topic is important and decide to
  read on

- Should avoid trying to define or explain the topic here. It is very
  hard to explain anything that the reader hasn't seen.

- Rarely needs more than three short paragraphs in addition to the
  bulleted list of the topics covered.

# General text style

These are the general rules of style that will be applied everywhere in
a Packt book:

- Use American English: color instead of colour, among instead of
  amongst, while instead of whilst.

- Footnotes are not used

- Latin abbreviations such as \"etc.\", \"e.g.\", \"i.e.\", and \"viz.\"
  should not be used. Expressions such as \"and so on\", \"among
  others\", \"for example\", \"such as\", \"that is\", and \"namely\"
  are preferred alternatives.

# Structuring information with headings

Headings are maybe _the_ most important device in your author\'s
toolbox. They help you, and they help your reader. Generally you want to
follow this scheme:

- Topics
  - Tasks.
    - Sub-tasks.

You never want to jump from a 1 to a 3. You can go from 1, to 2, to 3,
and back to 1. But never jump from a topic to a sub-task.

## Distinguishing your core topics

Firstly, you need to outline your core topics. A chapter should have 3-5
core topics which the reader can take away feeling confident they have a
strong grasp of. These are the meta-level objectives of the chapter. For
example, with this chapter each top level heading teaches a fundamental
technique the reader needs to learn.

A book on beginner-level programming might have a chapter which covers
basic variable information for example. Your top-tier topics could
include:

- Understanding variables

- Assigning types

- Performing basic operations

By the end of a core task, or topic, the reader should have hit a key
milestone and have created something they did not have before. By the
end of the chapter, they should have created 3-5 things which add up to
a roughly complete article. The best chapters use headings to tell the
story of the chapter at-a-glance. Your reader should be able to use your
level 1 and 2 headings to understand the topic coverage, and maybe even
learn some useful information from the topics alone. They should also
know what they will be _doing_ with that information. There are a number
of devices you can use for this.

## Organizing hierarchically

Now you\'ve got your main topics, you think about the core steps needed
to undertake that activity. This is where your level 2 headings come in.
Level 2 headings are where you outline the _specific tasks_ the reader
will need to perform. They should be things the reader _does_.

Level 3 headings should be used when you\'ve got lots of small tasks
which will only take a paragraph or two to explain. Additionally, level
3 headings can be great when you\'ve got loads of small items you want
to list, but feel you need greater nesting.

## Showing the reader what they will be doing

Each heading should guide the reader through what they will be doing
with the chapter. Ideally, each chapter won\'t just be the topic name.
You\'ll be telling the reader exactly what they will _do_ with that
section or sub-section. Let\'s say for the sake of argument, we\'re
going to do a chapter on creating a complete website with HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript.

- Creating your website structure with HTML

- Structuring your content semantically with elements

- Applying metadata

- Creating style with CSS

- Customizing text elements

- Coloring your website

- Selecting specific sections with selectors

- Manipulating specific elements with IDs and classes

- Creating interactivity with JavaScript

- Programming fundamentals

- Creating interactive functions.

It\'s telling a story, and showing the reader the progression. When
using technical terms, no matter how basic, it\'s telling the reader in
simple language what they _do_ with those terms. Here are a few basic
principles:

- Tell the reader what they will have at the end of the section

- Avoid generic terms like \"advanced\", or \"basic\", or \"more X with
  Y\".

- Use gerund form (\"-ing\" words)

- Use technical terms only if saying what you _do_ with them

Sometimes it\'s not always easy to apply all these (especially using
gerund: editors furrow many brows trying to get it to fit. Sometime it
just isn\'t possible). Try to wherever possible. Imagine yourself
telling the story of the chapter with your headings. You might have seen
some fiction books that sum up what happens on a page with a sentence at
the top. Use your headings like that.

# Delivering information with paragraphs

Paragraphs are the key attribute of any book, technical or otherwise. If
headings are your skeleton, paragraphs are the meat on the bone. A
strong paragraph will be convey one point of interest to the reader,
explain it, and point the reader to the next point of interest. You
don\'t want your paragraphs to become too fatty either though - you want
them to be lean and tasty.

## Structuring paragraphs

You should follow a very simple structure with each paragraph. You start
by introducing a point that you want the reader to learn. If it's
relevant, explain how they do something. You can explain it in as much
detail as you need, and if possible give an example. Explain why it is
worth knowing. Then point the reader to the next key point.

In summary, you should generally use this format:

- **Point** - What are they learning?

- **Instruct** - Tell the reader how to _do_ something.

- **Explain** - Give details of how it functions.

- **Example** - When will this apply in their own work? Particularly
  stress why it\'s useful.

- **Signpost** - Where will they go next?

  You don't need to use all of these in a paragraph. But these are the
  kinds of information types you will be giving the reader.

Avoid complex sentences with multiple clauses. Nobody wants to read a
paragraph -- or what looks like a paragraph -- which is really just one
long sentence. Use clear, concise English. It's easier to write and
easier to read.

## Visually presenting paragraphs

Surely, if you\'re presenting written information, the words themselves
should be enough? Why worry about what it looks like on the page?
Information density in a paragraph is important. A dense paragraph, many
sentences and lines long will lose your reader. A page of single
sentences on a single topic is similarly disruptive, because it makes it
difficult to distinguish the hierarchy of information. Many readers
generally don\'t read things line by line, or word by word, but quickly
take in the general meaning of a paragraph. By ensuring each paragraph
covers one key point they\'re more likely to understand it.

_A note about URLs:_ URLs are ugly and visually disturbing. They
regularly disrupt how the reader processes a paragraph with a good deal
of computer-output that the reader does not need to comprehend - just
type in or click on. Put them following a paragraph, or in a box-out
(see below).

## Writing concise paragraphs

When writing a paragraph, start by writing a sentence summing up the
point of the paragraph. Think to yourself, do you need any additional
information, or does the sentence stand by itself? Think critically
about how much you need to expand on a topic. Readers of technical books
want clear, concise information that quickly conveys a point and moves
onto the next subject.

When you've written a paragraph, critically dissect it again. Are any
sentences tangential to the central point? Remove them. Do you repeat
yourself in any? Remove them.

If you've got lots of little single sentence paragraphs, chances are you
should be using bullet points. Which brings us to the next section\...

# Breaking information down with lists

Lists are powerful tools. They allow you to quickly and succinctly
convey key points you want the reader to remember, or break down a set
of instructions into steps.

## Applying bullet points

Bullet points (also known as unordered lists) are one of the most
powerful means of structuring information in your book. However, they
should be used carefully, so as to present the information succinctly,
and in a visual manner which aids comprehension and ease of reading.

Good bullet points are:

- **Succinct**: They should deliver a point you want the reader to
  remember, but not have any extended discussion.

- **Short**: Linked to succinctness, they should be no longer than 2,
  maybe 3 lines.

- **Consistent**: Follow a clear pattern of **item**: description.

- **Supporting**: Bullet points should aid comprehension by explaining
  points cleanly that might be lost in body text.

- **Supported**: Never have a section comprised purely of bullet points.
  Try to book end it with body text before and after.

- **Strategic**: Got a list of items substantially more than about 10?
  Break it down into sub-sections, and separate them with body text.
  Similarly, the bulk of your content should not be in bullet points.

Bullet points should never comprise the key area in which you will
discuss concepts. Good bullet points are there to give the reader a
clear and easy-to-read reference that stands out visually. You don't
want to overload them with information. Body text is the key place for
more detailed information.

### Nesting bullet points

Never use more than 1 additional level of nesting -- this disrupts the
visual delivery, and confuse readers. You would be better off describing
Item 1, then having list with one level of nesting only. Then you would
describe Item 2.

## Numbered lists

Numbered lists (ordered lists, or numbered bullets) are a superb tool
for illustrating a sequence of steps. However, they should be used
carefully. Consider the following:

- **Concise**: Anything more than roughly 10-15 steps should be broken
  down further using other structural elements further. The reader
  shouldn't be flicking through for pages wondering when the
  instructions will end.

- **Distinct**: Try not to combine numbered bullets with other layout
  elements, as it makes it harder for the reader to follow those steps.

- **Images**: These are fine, but each step should have only one image.

- **Paragraphs**: With numbered bullet points, you can use longer
  paragraphs, though try to avoid multiple paragraphs.

### Determining what a "step" is

The key with numbered lists is to be careful about determining a new
step against what is just a sub-unit of another step. Consider this
example:

1.  Click **Save**.

2.  You have now saved your document.

3.  Click **File**.

4.  Click **Open**.

5.  Select your file.

6.  Click **Open**.

We don't really need individual clicks and what they do to be separate.
In fact, if you're just describing a few simple mouse-clicks, do it all
in one step. Make sure each step in a sequence of events is clearly
distinct from the other steps in your numbered bullet points list. The
above example could be changed to:

1.  Click **Save**. This saves your document.

<!-- -->

7.  To open it again, simply click **Open**, select your file, and click
    **Open**.

### Nesting numbered lists

If you've got a list of steps comprised of larger milestones and small
instructions you can use nested numbered lists to organize the
instructions. For example:

1.  First, create a new customer profile, by clicking on **Create New
    Profile**

<!-- -->

8.  Fill out their **First Name** and **Surname** fields.

9.  Select their location in the **Country** field.

10. Now, you need to assign them to a department. Click on **Assign**
    **Department**.

11. Select which department to assign them to from the dropdown field.

12. Next, assign them to an employee from the dropdown field.

13. Make sure **Notify** **Employee** **via** **Email** is checked.

14. Finally, click on **Save** to finalize the new customer profile.

The problem here is that there's no differentiation between the wider
steps (creating a profile, assigning it to the right person, and saving
it) and the smaller instructions to achieve those steps. Let's try
organizing it differently:

1.  First, create a new customer profile, by clicking on **Create New
    Profile**

<!-- -->

1.  Fill out their **First** **Name** and **Surname** fields.

2.  Select their location in the **Country** field.

<!-- -->

2.  Now, you need to assign them to a department. Click on **Assign**
    **Department**.

<!-- -->

1.  Select which department to assign them to from the dropdown field.

<!-- -->

3.  Next, assign them to an employee from the dropdown field.

4.  Make sure **Notify** **Employee via Email** is checked.

<!-- -->

3.  Finally, click on **Save** to finalize the new customer profile.

As you can see, this clearly breaks things down between \"larger\", meta
tasks, and specific things (like \"click on X\").

# Describing code samples

Code samples are possibly the most important tool in your author's
arsenal. However, the art of explaining code in books is a tricky one.
Firstly, a few golden rules.

- Aim for a general max of about 20 lines.

- If you absolutely have to, go to 30 lines.

- If you write a page or more of code, your editor will ask for
  revisions.

- Break it down -- the rule of thumb is to separate where you would
  normally comment.

- Avoid use in-code comments -- they're a sign you need to write
  something outside the code sample about it!

- When you intend to describe a specific section in the sample highlight
  it.

**Learning series exception**: the exception to the 20:30 rule are
Learning series books; if you're writing one, the first half of the book
should really have 10 line samples maximum. You're dealing with much
newer adopters to the technology, largely. You need to break it down
further.

## The sample

Let's look at a number of ways we could describe this fairly simple
Python code sample. It's a very simple program that scans the input and
detects the largest number and smallest number in that input.

numArray = \[1, 5, 3, 12, 14, 75, 37, 83\]\
largestNumber = None\
smallestNumber = None\
\
print (\"\\nOur numbers are: \", numArray)\
\
for num in numArray:\
if smallestNumber is None and largestNumber is None:\
smallestNumber = num\
largestNumber = num\
elif num \> largestNumber:\
largestNumber = num\
elif num \< smallestNumber:\
smallestNumber = num\
print (\"Smallest Number:\", smallestNumber, \"Largest Number:\",
largestNumber, \"Current Number:\", num)\
\
print (\"The largest number is:\", largestNumber)\
print (\"The smallest number is:\", smallestNumber)

## Breaking it down

Just pasting this one in there, and explaining it in a paragraph
underneath isn't going to work. A more advanced audience will probably
get it, but the more beginner your audience, and the earlier in the book
you are, the more you should break code samples down. You can always
refer the reader to the sample available for download from Packt, or
more preferably these days on a GitHub repo. The example's a little
contrived, as it's designed to explain the maximum amount of information
about the lines, to a basic reader.

We're going to try breaking this one down significantly now. Everything
from this point is a mock example of explaining code.

### The example

To start with, open up sample.py.

numArray = \[1, 5, 3, 12, 14, 75, 37, 83\]\
largestNumber = None\
smallestNumber = None

First, we declare our variables. numArray is our input. It houses each
of the comma-separated integers (whole numbers) which our program will
search for. Both largestNumber and smallestNumber hold the Python
special type None. This special type allows you to set a null value for
the variable. You'll see why we use this soon.

Let's start by displaying to the user what numbers Python will be
processing.

print (\"\\nOur numbers are: \", numArray)

print()sends the item in brackets to the user display inside Python. It
is a standard Python Built-In Function. Items inside quotation marks are
strings.

The \\n is an escape sequence. You'll notice that \\n is not printed
when executing the programme. What you instead notice is that it in fact
creates a line break in the output. See Chapter X, Python Escape
Sequences for more information.

Now, we begin the main task of the program: processing the input. For
this we will be using a for loop. A for loop repeatedly executes either
until the condition at the beginning of the statement is complete.

for num in numArray:\
\
if smallestNumber is None and largestNumber is None:\
smallestNumber = num\
largestNumber = num\
elif num \> largestNumber:\
largestNumber = num\
elif num \< smallestNumber:\
smallestNumber = num\
print (\"Smallest Number:\", smallestNumber, \"Largest Number:\",\\\
largestNumber, \"Current Number:\", num)

The first line states for num in numArray. This quite simply means that
Python will run through each of the integers in the array called
numArray, and for each of them will perform the commands after the
colon.

We then indent to perform the first step. This is an if statement. This
asks Python to check whether or not the two variables smallestNumber and
largestNumber contain the value None. If they do, then Python executes
the steps indented following the colon. In this case, the variables are
set to the value of the value of num.

This only runs the first time. After that, we use elif which allows us
to check if the current integer in this iteration is larger or smaller
than the one held in largestNumber or smallestNumber respectively. If
this is the case, Python then tells the program to change the values of
largestNumber or smallestNumber to the new largest or smallest integers.

The final section of our for loop tells Python to tell the user what the
current iteration has found. Having completed this iteration, the for
loop resets, and checks again until the original conditions have been
met.

With the logic complete, and the answer found, Python displays the final
output:

print (\"The largest number is:\", largestNumber)\
print (\"The smallest number is:\", smallestNumber)\
The complete user output is:

Let\'s take a quick look at how this will appear on the screen: ![ss
(2014-07-04 at
11.28.12).jpg](media/image1.jpeg){width="5.447916666666667in"
height="2.7916666666666665in"} \[0000OS_01_01.png\]

And that's the completed explanation.

## Explaining this sample

You'll notice this example uses a number of devices. Firstly, it heavily
breaks down the code sample into its main logic blocks. It anticipates
that the reader cannot look at the whole code sample and instantly
understand it.

Key to explaining the code is linking up sections highlighted in the
code which are of particular interest (using Code Highlighted \[PACKT\])
with those explained in the body text. Using Code in Text \[PACKT\]
helps further link the samples and body text.

The most important thing is that you constantly evaluate each sample,
and try to work out if you've explained the core concepts of that code
sample before -- or whether or not the target audience will understand
it.

# Box-outs

Sometimes you want to give the reader some extra information, outside
the main body of the text. Packt has a couple of options for this.

## Information box

These are great for giving the reader additional information. It marks
it as useful to the topic at hand, but that they can possibly skip it.
It\'s a reference.

## Tip

Got a best-practice, useful link, or general tip or trick? Use one of
these. You\'re telling the reader the information is optional, but they
may find it useful.

# Illustrating with images

Images should adhere to the following standards:

- 300 DPI

- 5.5 inches tall

- 5.5 inches wide

- .png file format

Please use the following image file name format:
bookRef_bookNumber_imageNumber.png

e.g.

B12043_01_01.png

Furthermore, we would strongly request that you write the filename
information underneath the image, preferably laid out with Layout
Information \[PACKT\]

![http://puu.sh/am3Ix/c981c9413e.png](media/image2.png){width="5.5in"
height="5.46875in"}

B12043_01_01.png

## Using images effectively

Good images generally:

- **Consider printing requirements**: Although most sales are eBooks,
  you need to consider that our printed copies are black and white. Try
  to use images that are lighter overall, with strong, dark and clear
  text.

- **However**: We do also provide the images as downloadable items, if
  there's no alternative.

- **Command Line Output**: This should be done using Command Line
  \[PACKT\] rather than images.

We can redraw diagrams in house, if you would prefer to roughly sketch
them out or use another placeholder indicating what you need us to draw.
Please let us know when you submit a chapter which images you would like
us to redraw.
