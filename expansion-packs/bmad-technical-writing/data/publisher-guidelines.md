## General Publisher Considerations

### Royalty Structures
- Traditional publishers: 8-15% of net (after retailer cut)
- Self-publishing: 35-70% of gross (varies by platform)
- Advance payments vary widely (technical books: $5K-$25K typical, can be much higher for established authors)

### Rights and Licensing
- Traditional: publisher typically gets exclusive rights for term
- Self-publishing: you retain all rights
- Code licensing: often separate from book copyright
- Translation rights negotiable

### Marketing and Promotion
- Traditional publisher provides some marketing, author expected to promote
- Self-publishing: 100% author responsibility
- Author platform important for both (blog, social media, speaking)
- Technical community engagement valuable

### Timeline Considerations
- Traditional: 6-18 months from contract to publication
- Self-publishing: author controls timeline (can publish immediately or over time)
- Both: writing typically takes 6-12 months for comprehensive book

## Choosing the Right Publisher

### Traditional Publisher When:
- You want professional editing and production
- Marketing support desired
- Credibility and imprint important
- Established distribution channels valued
- Royalty advance needed
- Don't want to manage production details

### Self-Publishing When:
- You want full control
- Higher per-book royalty important
- Quick time to market needed
- You have existing audience/platform
- You want to retain all rights
- Willing to handle production and marketing

### Hybrid Approach:
- Self-publish first to build audience
- Traditional deal for expanded/updated version
- Or reverse: traditional first, then self-publish later editions
- Different books with different publishers
