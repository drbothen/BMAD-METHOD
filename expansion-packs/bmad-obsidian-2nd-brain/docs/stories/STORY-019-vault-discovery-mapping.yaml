  ## Requirements Context (Source: EPIC-001)

  **From EPIC-001 Lines 18-23 - Key Capabilities:**
  - Support multiple methodologies: Zettelkasten, PARA, LYT, Johnny Decimal
  - Enable intelligent capture and triage
  - Automatic atomicity analysis and note fragmentation
  - Semantic bidirectional linking
  - Map of Content (MOC) construction

  **From EPIC-001 Lines 99-102 - Technical Dependencies:**
  - BMAD-METHOD core framework v4.x+
  - Obsidian v1.4.0+
  - Node.js v16+ (for MCP servers)
  - Docker (optional, for Neo4j)

  **From EPIC-001 Lines 110-112 - Related Research:**
  - `/Users/jmagady/Dev/BMAD-METHOD/manuscripts/bmad-obsidian-2nd-brain-requirements.md`
  - `/Users/jmagady/Dev/BMAD-METHOD/manuscripts/bmad-obsidian-2nd-brain-research-enhancement.md`

  ## Research Insights

  **Vault Organization Diversity:**
  (Source: bmad-obsidian-2nd-brain-research-enhancement.md and EPIC-001 requirements)

  Users employ diverse organizational systems per EPIC-001 Line 20:
  - **PARA**: Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives (project-based, 4 main categories)
  - **Zettelkasten**: Flat structure, link-heavy, atomic notes
  - **LYT**: Map of Contents (MOC)-centric, flexible linking
  - **Johnny Decimal**: Strict numerical categorization (10-19, 20-29, etc.)
  - **ACE**: Location, alphabet, time, category, relevance
  - **Hybrid**: Combinations of above approaches

  **Critical Requirements:**
  1. Don't assume folder structure (per EPIC-001 multi-methodology support)
  2. Support multiple vaults per user
  3. Allow per-vault configuration
  4. Respect user's organizational preferences
  5. Provide sensible defaults with override capability

  ## Configuration Hierarchy

  Configuration precedence (from research and expansion pack patterns):
  1. Hardcoded defaults (in utility code)
  2. Expansion pack config.yaml (global defaults)
  3. vault-mappings.yaml (per-vault settings) ← **This story creates this**
  4. Vault-local overrides (.obsidian/.bmad/config.json) - Future enhancement
  5. Runtime overrides (environment variables)

  **vault-mappings.yaml Location:**
  `expansion-packs/bmad-obsidian-2nd-brain/config/vault-mappings.yaml`

  This location chosen because:
  - Keeps vault config with expansion pack
  - Separate from .bmad-core (which is for installed projects)
  - Can be version-controlled with expansion pack
  - Easy to find alongside config.yaml

  ## Obsidian Vault Detection

  **Obsidian Configuration Locations:**
  (Source: Obsidian developer documentation and community patterns)

  - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/obsidian/obsidian.json`
  - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Obsidian\obsidian.json`
  - **Linux**: `~/.config/obsidian/obsidian.json`

  **obsidian.json Structure:**
  Contains `vaults` object with vault IDs as keys:
  ```json
  {
    "vaults": {
      "vault-id-123": {
        "path": "/Users/username/Documents/MyVault",
        "ts": 1699564800000,
        "open": true
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  Each vault directory contains `.obsidian/` folder with vault-specific config.

  ## Node.js Dependencies

  **Required from package.json (Node.js v16+ per EPIC-001):**
  - `fs` (built-in) - File system operations
  - `path` (built-in) - Cross-platform path handling
  - `os` (built-in) - OS detection for config paths
  - `js-yaml` (existing dep) - YAML parsing/generation
  - `chalk` (existing dep) - CLI colored output
  - `inquirer` (existing dep) - Interactive CLI prompts

  **Test Dependencies:**
  - No external test framework required (follow existing pattern)
  - Tests are standalone Node.js scripts (see tests/integration/)
  - Executed via npm scripts in root package.json

  ## Security Requirements

  **Path Validation (OWASP Top 10 - Path Traversal Prevention):**
  1. Use `path.resolve()` to normalize all paths
  2. Validate resolved paths are within expected boundaries
  3. Never trust user input - sanitize all file paths
  4. Check for path traversal attempts: `../`, `..\\`

  **CLI Input Sanitization:**
  1. Validate vault IDs match expected format (alphanumeric, hyphens only)
  2. Escape special characters in file paths before shell operations
  3. Prevent command injection in CLI arguments

  **File System Access:**
  1. Check read/write permissions before operations (prevent TOCTOU issues)
  2. Handle symbolic links safely - resolve to real paths
  3. Validate vault accessibility atomically
  4. Fail safely with clear error messages

  **Example Security Pattern:**
  ```javascript
  const path = require('path');

  function validateVaultPath(userPath, allowedBaseDir) {
    const resolved = path.resolve(userPath);
    const normalized = path.normalize(resolved);

    // Prevent path traversal
    if (!normalized.startsWith(allowedBaseDir)) {
      throw new Error('Path outside allowed directory');
    }

    // Check accessibility
    if (!fs.existsSync(normalized)) {
      throw new Error('Path does not exist');
    }

    return normalized;
  }
  ```

  ## CLI Integration Context

  **No package.json in Expansion Pack:**
  - Expansion packs don't have their own package.json
  - CLI commands added to root package.json (line 22-24 shows bin structure)
  - Follow existing pattern: `test:neo4j`, `test:graphiti`, etc. (lines 46-49)

  **Command Naming Convention:**
  Since this is expansion-pack-specific, commands should be prefixed:
  - `bmad-2b:vault:add` (alternative naming, following expansion pattern)
  - Or add to root npm scripts: `npm run vault:discover`

  **For This Story:**
  Tools are utility scripts, not CLI commands. CLI commands can be added in future story.
  Focus on creating vault-discovery.js and vault-analyzer.js as Node.js modules/scripts.

  ## Testing Standards

  **Test Location:**
  `expansion-packs/bmad-obsidian-2nd-brain/tests/integration/test-vault-discovery.js`

  **Test Framework:**
  - None - use standalone Node.js scripts (existing pattern)
  - See examples: test-neo4j-connection.js, test-graphiti-mcp-connection.js

  **Test Pattern:**
  ```javascript
  #!/usr/bin/env node
  // Test description and usage comments
  // Use node:http, node:https, node:fs built-ins
  // Create COLORS object for terminal output
  // Track results.passed and results.failed
  // Exit with code 0 (success) or 1 (failure)
  ```

  **Test Execution:**
  Add to root package.json scripts:
  ```json
  "test:vault-discovery": "node expansion-packs/bmad-obsidian-2nd-brain/tests/integration/test-vault-discovery.js"
  ```

  **Test Coverage Required (from testing section):**
  - Multiple OS paths (mock for non-current OS)
  - 0, 1, and multiple vaults
  - Different organization methods (PARA, Zettelkasten, etc.)
  - Invalid paths and error conditions
  - Moved/deleted vaults (graceful handling)

  ## Implementation Notes

  - Use Node.js fs and path modules for cross-platform compatibility
  - Handle symlinks with fs.realpathSync() before validation
  - Validate vault accessibility before adding (check permissions)
  - Provide clear error messages for inaccessible vaults
  - Support both relative and absolute paths (normalize to absolute)
  - Handle spaces and special characters in paths (proper escaping)
  - Use fs.accessSync() with fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK for permission checks

  ## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for This Story)

  - Auto-detect when vaults are added/removed from Obsidian (file watching)
  - Sync vault list from Obsidian automatically (periodic polling)
  - Support Obsidian Sync vaults (cloud-based, different paths)
  - Provide GUI for vault configuration (web-based interface)

dependencies:
  - STORY-001: Expansion pack infrastructure and installation location (prerequisite)
  - STORY-015: Obsidian MCP integration for vault access (prerequisite)
  - STORY-023: Vault initialization modes greenfield/brownfield (future integration)
  - Node.js v16+ (per EPIC-001 Line 101)
  - Built-in Node modules: fs, path, os
  - Existing dependencies from root package.json: js-yaml, chalk, inquirer
  - EPIC-001: Multi-methodology support requirements (Lines 18-23)
  - Research: /Users/jmagady/Dev/BMAD-METHOD/manuscripts/bmad-obsidian-2nd-brain-research-enhancement.md

testing: |
  **Test File:** `expansion-packs/bmad-obsidian-2nd-brain/tests/integration/test-vault-discovery.js`

  **Test Framework:** Standalone Node.js script (no external framework)

  **Test Pattern:** Follow existing test-neo4j-connection.js and test-graphiti-mcp-connection.js patterns

  **Test Execution:**
  ```bash
  npm run test:vault-discovery
  # Or directly:
  node expansion-packs/bmad-obsidian-2nd-brain/tests/integration/test-vault-discovery.js
  ```

  **Test Coverage:**
  - Vault discovery on current OS (mock obsidian.json for other OSs)
  - Test with 0 vaults (no Obsidian config found)
  - Test with 1 vault (single vault configuration)
  - Test with multiple vaults (3+ vaults)
  - Test with vaults using different organization methods (PARA, Zettelkasten, LYT, Johnny Decimal)
  - Test with vaults in different locations (absolute paths, home directory, Documents)
  - Test vault path validation (invalid paths, non-existent paths)
  - Test security validation (path traversal attempts, special characters)
  - Test configuration file creation and YAML parsing
  - Test vault enabling/disabling functionality
  - Test vault add/remove operations
  - Verify graceful handling of moved/deleted vaults (path no longer exists)
  - Test symbolic link resolution
  - Test permission checking (readable/writable vaults)

  **Exit Codes:**
  - 0: All tests passed
  - 1: One or more tests failed

  **See Dev Notes "Testing Standards" section for complete test pattern details.**
