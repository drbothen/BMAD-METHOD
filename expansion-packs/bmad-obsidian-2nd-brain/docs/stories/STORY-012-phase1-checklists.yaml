  As a developer
  I want to create validation checklists for Phase 1 workflows
  So that agents can enforce quality standards systematically

acceptance_criteria:
  - Create checklists/ directory
  - Create capture-quality-checklist.md
  - Create atomicity-checklist.md
  - Create linking-quality-checklist.md
  - Create query-completeness-checklist.md
  - Create audit-coverage-checklist.md
  - All checklists include items, pass criteria, and usage notes
  - Checklists specify required vs. optional items
  - Checklists include validation logic

technical_notes: |

    - ✓ Related concepts surfaced
    - ✓ Knowledge gaps identified
    - Suggested follow-up queries provided

  - Used by: Query Interpreter Agent (merge-results task)

  Checklist 5: audit-coverage-checklist.md
  - Purpose: Ensure audit comprehensively reviews all quality dimensions
  - Items (12 total, all required):
    - Temporal freshness checked
    - External links validated
    - Source citations verified
    - Orphaned notes identified
    - Factual claims spot-checked
    - Duplicate content detected
    - Atomicity violations flagged
    - MOC coverage assessed
    - Metadata completeness verified
    - Neo4j data integrity checked (if enabled)
    - Audit scope clearly defined
    - Priority rankings justified
  - Pass criteria: All items checked
  - Used by: Quality Auditor Agent (generate-audit-report task)

dependencies:
  - STORY-001: Expansion pack infrastructure
  - All Phase 1 agents (consumers of checklists)

testing:
  - Validate checklist format (markdown checkboxes)
  - Test each checklist with sample content
  - Verify pass criteria logic
  - Ensure checklists are comprehensive

definition_of_done:
  - All 5 checklist files created in checklists/
  - Checklists include items with checkbox format
  - Required vs. optional items clearly marked
  - Pass criteria specified
  - Usage notes documented
  - Checklists tested with sample content
  - Documentation added to developer guide

  reviewed_by: "Quinn (Test Architect)"

  code_quality_assessment: |
    Exceptional quality across all deliverables. All 5 required checklists demonstrate:
    - Comprehensive quality criteria with sophisticated scoring algorithms
    - Clear pass/fail conditions with actionable remediation steps
    - Security considerations deeply embedded (XSS, injection, SSRF prevention)
    - Integration patterns with other checklists well-documented
    - Performance budgets clearly defined throughout
    - Graceful degradation patterns for optional dependencies

    BONUS: 6th checklist (relationship-confidence-checklist.md) adds significant value
    by supporting linking-quality with confidence scoring logic.

    Minor implementation variations from technical_notes are IMPROVEMENTS:
    - atomicity: 11 items vs 10 (added security test)
    - linking-quality: 11 items vs 9 (added atomicity & security tests)
    - capture-quality: 6 required vs 5 (enhanced security)

  compliance_check:
    - "Coding Standards: ✓ - Well-structured markdown with consistent formatting"
    - "Project Structure: ✓ - Proper location in expansion-packs/bmad-obsidian-2nd-brain/checklists/"
    - "Testing Strategy: ✗ - No test validation artifacts found (DoD item 6 incomplete)"
    - "All ACs Met: ✓ - All 9 acceptance criteria met with enhancements"

  improvements_checklist:
    - "[ ] Create test validation suite for all 5 checklists with sample content (DoD item 6)"
    - "[ ] Add checklist usage documentation to README.md or create developer guide (DoD item 7)"
    - "[ ] Update story technical_notes to reflect actual item counts (enhancements documented)"
    - "[ ] Consider process improvement: stories should be in 'Review' status before QA, not 'done'"

  security_review: |
    PASS - Outstanding security considerations throughout:
    - XSS prevention (script tag stripping, HTML escaping)
    - Injection protection (parameterized queries, input validation)
    - SSRF prevention (private IP blocking, protocol validation)
    - Path traversal protection (directory traversal checks)
    - Rate limiting (external requests throttled)
    - Credential protection (auth token stripping from URLs)

    All checklists include security tests as explicit criteria.

  performance_considerations: |
    PASS - Performance budgets clearly defined:
    - Query operations: <3 seconds total (query-completeness)
    - Temporal audit: <10s for 1000 notes (audit-coverage)
    - Link validation: Rate limited to 5 req/sec (capture-quality, linking-quality)
    - Atomicity analysis: Sampling strategy for large vaults

    Progressive modes documented for large-scale operations.

  gate_status: |
    Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/EPIC-001.STORY-012-phase1-checklists.yml

    Rationale: Functional deliverables are excellent (quality_score: 80/100),
    but Definition of Done items 6 (testing) and 7 (documentation) are incomplete.

  recommended_status: |
    ✗ Changes Required - See unchecked items in improvements_checklist above

    The functional work is production-ready, but process completion requires:
    1. Test validation suite creation
    2. Developer guide documentation

    Story owner should address these items before final sign-off.
