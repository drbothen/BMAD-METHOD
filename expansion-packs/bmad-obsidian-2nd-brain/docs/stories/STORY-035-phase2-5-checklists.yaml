  As a developer
  I want validation checklists for Phases 2-5 workflows
  So that agents can enforce quality standards systematically across all phases

acceptance_criteria:
  - Create 15 checklists for Phases 2-5
  - Phase 2: 3 checklists (MOC, temporal analysis, narrative)
  - Phase 3: 2 checklists (content brief, publication)
  - Phase 4: 2 checklists (gap identification, prioritization)
  - Phase 5: 5 checklists (research quality, source credibility, tool optimization, synthesis, accuracy)
  - Additional: 3 checklists (duplicate detection, privacy compliance, contradiction resolution)
  - All checklists include items, pass criteria, and usage notes
  - Checklists specify required vs. optional items
  - Checklists include validation logic

  ## Checklist Design Philosophy

  All checklists follow **consistent structure**:
  - Purpose: What quality dimension does this validate?
  - Items: Specific checks to perform (10-15 items typical)
  - Required vs Optional: ✓ marks required items
  - Pass Criteria: What must be true to pass?
  - Usage: Which agents use this checklist?

  ## Checklist Integration Patterns

  **Agent Usage:**
  - Agents load checklists via dependencies
  - Checklists run during task execution
  - Failed checks block workflow (unless Yolo mode)
  - Check results logged for quality tracking

  **Validation Logic:**
  - Required items must all pass
  - Optional items are recommendations
  - Thresholds must be met (e.g., credibility ≥ 75)
  - Counts must be satisfied (e.g., ≥ 3 sources)

  ## Quality Thresholds

  **Research Quality Standards:**
  - Average credibility ≥ 75 (Reliable+)
  - Cross-validated claims ≥ 95%
  - Unresolved conflicts < 5%
  - Completeness score ≥ 80/100

  **Content Quality Standards:**
  - MOC coverage: ≤50 direct links (avoid overload)
  - Brief evidence: ≥3 pieces minimum
  - Publication: All privacy checks pass (100%)

  ## Checklist Versioning

  Checklists may evolve:
  - v1.0: Initial checklist
  - v1.1: Added items based on usage
  - v2.0: Major revision (new validation logic)

  Track version in checklist file header.

dependencies:
  - All Phase 2-5 agents use these checklists
  - MOC Constructor Agent (moc-completeness)
  - Timeline Constructor Agent (temporal-accuracy, narrative-completeness)
  - Content Brief Agent (brief-completeness)
  - Publication Formatter Agent (publication-quality, publication-privacy)
  - Gap Detector Agent (gap-identification, prioritization, contradiction-resolution)
  - Research Coordinator Agent (research-quality, source-credibility, tool-optimization, research-synthesis, research-accuracy)
  - Structural Analysis Agent (duplicate-detection)
  - Semantic Linker Agent (contradiction-resolution)

testing:
  - Test each checklist with passing scenarios
  - Test each checklist with failing scenarios
  - Validate required vs optional item logic
  - Test threshold validation (credibility, completeness, etc.)
  - Verify agent integration (checklists load correctly)
  - Test Yolo mode bypass (warnings but no blocking)
  - Validate checklist versioning
  - Test with edge cases (empty values, boundary conditions)

definition_of_done:
  - All 15 checklists created in checklists/ directory
  - Each checklist follows standard structure
  - Required items clearly marked with ✓
  - Pass criteria defined for each checklist
  - Usage notes specify which agents use checklist
  - Validation logic documented
  - Quality thresholds specified where applicable
  - All checklists tested with passing and failing scenarios
  - Integration with agents verified
  - Checklist format and usage documented
