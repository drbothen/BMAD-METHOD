user_story: |
  As an AI agent
  I want access to comprehensive knowledge bases about methodologies and technical systems
  So that I can provide informed guidance to users

acceptance_criteria:
  - Create data/ directory
  - Inherit bmad-kb.md from bmad-core (symbolic link or copy)
  - Create second-brain-methodologies.md (focused on Zettelkasten + PARA for Phase 1)
  - Create obsidian-technical-guide.md (basics for Phase 1)
  - All knowledge bases in markdown format
  - Knowledge bases include examples and patterns
  - Knowledge bases cross-reference each other

technical_notes: |
  Knowledge Base 1: bmad-kb.md (inherited)
  - Source: bmad-core/data/bmad-kb.md
  - Purpose: Core BMAD methodology and framework principles
  - Content: Agent system, task structure, template format, workflow patterns
  - Implementation: Symbolic link or copy during installation
  - Usage: Referenced by all agents for BMAD conventions

  Knowledge Base 2: second-brain-methodologies.md
  - Purpose: Guide to 2nd brain methodologies (Phase 1 focus)
  - Content (Phase 1):
    - Zettelkasten Method:
      - History and principles (Niklas Luhmann)
      - Atomic notes definition and 6 building block types
      - Atomicity as outcome vs. input requirement
      - Fleeting → Literature → Permanent note workflow
      - Unique identifiers and linking conventions
    - PARA Method:
      - Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives taxonomy
      - Actionability-based organization
      - Information lifecycle management
      - Project vs. Area distinction
  - Note: Phase 2 will add LYT, Phase 6 will add Johnny Decimal, Progressive Summarization
  - Usage: Reference for agents implementing methodology features

  Knowledge Base 3: obsidian-technical-guide.md
  - Purpose: Technical details of Obsidian ecosystem (Phase 1 basics)
  - Content (Phase 1):
    - Obsidian Architecture:
      - Vault structure (folders, files, hidden files)
      - Markdown format and Obsidian extensions
      - Wikilink syntax: [[note]], [[note|display]], [[note#section]]
      - Tag syntax: #tag, #nested/tag
      - Frontmatter (YAML metadata)
    - Smart Connections:
      - .smart-env/ directory structure
      - Embedding model: BGE-micro-v2 specifications
      - .ajson format (Annotated JSON)
      - Semantic search API basics
      - Performance characteristics (10,000+ notes)
    - Community Plugins:
      - Local REST API plugin setup
      - MCP Tools plugin setup
      - Smart Connections plugin setup
  - Note: Phase 2 will add Neo4j/Graphiti details, Phase 5 will add research MCP details
  - Usage: Technical reference for agents interfacing with Obsidian

dependencies:
  - STORY-001: Expansion pack infrastructure
  - bmad-core/data/bmad-kb.md (inherited)
  - All Phase 1 agents (consumers of knowledge bases)

testing:
  - Validate markdown formatting
  - Verify cross-references between knowledge bases
  - Test agent access to knowledge bases
  - Ensure examples are accurate
  - Verify technical specifications

definition_of_done:
  - bmad-kb.md inherited (symlink or copy)
  - second-brain-methodologies.md created with Zettelkasten + PARA
  - obsidian-technical-guide.md created with Phase 1 basics
  - All knowledge bases in markdown format
  - Examples and patterns included
  - Cross-references documented
  - Knowledge bases validated for accuracy
  - Documentation added to developer guide
