# Building Block Types Taxonomy

## Purpose

This taxonomy defines the 6 fundamental building block types used to classify atomic notes in the Zettelkasten system. Each atomic note should be clearly identifiable as one of these types to enable effective organization, linking, and knowledge synthesis.

## The 6 Building Block Types

---

### 1. CONCEPT

**Definition:** Explanation or definition of an idea, term, principle, or mental model

**Purpose:** Establish shared vocabulary and understanding of key ideas

**Structure:** Definition + Characteristics + Examples (optional)

**Key Characteristics:**

- Defines what something **is** or **means**
- Explains the nature or essence of an idea
- Provides boundaries (what it includes/excludes)
- Often includes etymology or history
- May include examples to clarify meaning

**Linguistic Signals:**

- "is defined as", "refers to", "means that"
- "the concept of", "the idea of"
- "in other words", "essentially"
- Definitional structure (X is Y)
- Use of "namely", "that is", "i.e."

**Common Structures:**

```markdown
# [Concept Name]

[Concept] is defined as [definition].

Key characteristics:

- [Characteristic 1]
- [Characteristic 2]
- [Characteristic 3]

For example, [example illustration].

This concept is important because [significance].
```

**Example Snippets:**

1. **Zettelkasten Principle: Atomicity**
   "The atomicity principle states that each note should contain exactly one complete idea that can stand alone. An atomic note is self-contained, complete, singular, and recombinable."

2. **Progressive Summarization**
   "Progressive Summarization is a technique for distilling information through multiple passes. Each pass highlights the most important parts, creating layers of increasingly compressed meaning."

3. **Evergreen Notes**
   "Evergreen notes are concept-oriented notes that evolve over time. Unlike fleeting notes, they are permanent, atomic, and densely linked to create a web of knowledge."

4. **Second Brain**
   "A Second Brain is an external, digital system for storing and organizing knowledge. It extends human memory by capturing ideas, insights, and information for later retrieval and synthesis."

5. **Bidirectional Linking**
   "Bidirectional linking creates two-way connections between notes. When Note A links to Note B, Note B automatically shows the backlink from Note A, revealing unexpected relationships."

---

### 2. ARGUMENT

**Definition:** Claim supported by evidence and reasoning to persuade or prove a point

**Purpose:** Present logical reasoning and evidence for beliefs or conclusions

**Structure:** Thesis/Claim + Evidence + Logic/Reasoning

**Key Characteristics:**

- Makes a clear, arguable claim
- Provides evidence to support the claim
- Explains the logical connection between evidence and claim
- May address counterarguments
- Has a persuasive or analytical intent

**Linguistic Signals:**

- "therefore", "thus", "consequently"
- "because", "since", "given that"
- "this shows that", "this proves that"
- "the evidence suggests", "research indicates"
- "furthermore", "moreover", "in addition"

**Common Structures:**

```markdown
# [Argument Title]

**Thesis:** [Clear statement of claim]

**Evidence:**

1. [Evidence point 1]
2. [Evidence point 2]
3. [Evidence point 3]

**Logic:** [Explanation of how evidence supports the claim]

**Implications:** [What this means or why it matters]
```

**Example Snippets:**

1. **Spaced Repetition Superior to Massed Practice**
   "Spaced repetition produces better long-term retention than cramming. Evidence: Ebbinghaus forgetting curve shows exponential decay; meta-analysis of 317 studies confirms spacing effect. Logic: The brain requires consolidation time between exposures."

2. **Atomic Notes Enable Better Knowledge Synthesis**
   "Breaking notes into atomic units improves synthesis capability. Small, focused notes can be recombined in unlimited ways, while large monolithic notes create rigid structures. This flexibility enables emergent insights through novel connections."

3. **Digital Note-Taking Outperforms Handwriting for Retrieval**
   "Digital notes are superior for long-term knowledge retrieval despite handwriting's encoding benefits. Digital enables full-text search, bidirectional linking, and version control. The retrieval advantage outweighs encoding disadvantage for long-term use."

4. **Zettelkasten Requires Critical Mass to Function**
   "A Zettelkasten needs 200+ atomic notes to generate value through serendipitous connections. Below this threshold, the network is too sparse for meaningful link discovery. This explains why many abandon the system prematurely."

5. **Folgezettel Not Necessary for Digital Zettelkasten**
   "Digital Zettelkasten systems don't need Luhmann's folgezettel numbering. Bidirectional links and full-text search provide superior navigation. The numbering system solved analog limitations that don't exist digitally."

---

### 3. MODEL

**Definition:** Framework, system, or structured representation showing components and relationships

**Purpose:** Provide mental models for understanding complex systems

**Structure:** Components + Relationships + Boundaries

**Key Characteristics:**

- Describes a system with multiple interrelated parts
- Shows how components interact or relate
- Defines boundaries (what's in/out of scope)
- Often visual or diagrammatic in nature
- Simplifies complexity for understanding

**Linguistic Signals:**

- "consists of", "comprises", "is made up of"
- "framework", "system", "model", "structure"
- "the relationship between", "how X connects to Y"
- "components", "elements", "parts"
- "process", "workflow", "cycle"

**Common Structures:**

```markdown
# [Model Name]

[Model] is a [framework/system] for [purpose].

**Components:**

1. [Component 1] - [Description and role]
2. [Component 2] - [Description and role]
3. [Component 3] - [Description and role]

**Relationships:** [How components interact]

**Boundaries:** [What's included/excluded]

**Application:** [When/how to use this model]
```

**Example Snippets:**

1. **PARA Method for Information Organization**
   "PARA organizes information into four categories: Projects (active work with deadlines), Areas (ongoing responsibilities), Resources (reference material), Archives (inactive items). Information flows from Projects → Areas → Resources → Archives as relevance decreases."

2. **Zettelkasten Three-Layer Structure**
   "Zettelkasten has three layers: Fleeting notes (temporary captures), Literature notes (processed from sources), Permanent notes (atomic knowledge). Information flows upward through progressive refinement from fleeting to permanent."

3. **Building a Second Brain CODE Method**
   "CODE is a four-step process: Capture (collect what resonates), Organize (categorize with PARA), Distill (progressive summarization), Express (create using knowledge). It transforms consumption into creation."

4. **Knowledge Work Feedback Loop**
   "Knowledge work cycles through: Capture → Process → Connect → Create → Share → Learn. Each output becomes input for the next iteration, creating a compounding knowledge flywheel."

5. **Note Maturity Spectrum**
   "Notes exist on a spectrum: Fleeting (raw capture) → Incubating (being processed) → Evergreen (mature and linked) → Crystallized (published/shared). Movement requires progressively more refinement and connection."

---

### 4. QUESTION

**Definition:** Open question, area of inquiry, or research direction

**Purpose:** Capture curiosity, knowledge gaps, and areas for exploration

**Structure:** Question + Context + Significance

**Key Characteristics:**

- Explicitly interrogative (ends with ?)
- Expresses uncertainty or curiosity
- Provides context for why the question matters
- May outline approaches to finding answers
- Often evolves into claims or arguments when answered

**Linguistic Signals:**

- Interrogative words: "what", "why", "how", "when", "where"
- "?" punctuation
- "I wonder", "unclear whether"
- "remains to be seen", "open question"
- "worth investigating", "need to explore"

**Common Structures:**

```markdown
# [Question]

**Context:** [Why this question arose, background]

**Significance:** [Why answering this matters]

**Current Understanding:** [What is known so far]

**Possible Approaches:** [How to investigate]

**Related Questions:**

- [[Related Question 1]]
- [[Related Question 2]]
```

**Example Snippets:**

1. **How Does Bi-Temporal Versioning Differ from Event Sourcing?**
   "Both patterns track state changes over time, but the mechanisms differ. Event sourcing stores events, bi-temporal tracks valid-time vs transaction-time. Understanding the distinction clarifies when to use each pattern."

2. **What is the Optimal Atomic Note Size?**
   "Atomicity requires 'one idea per note' but idea granularity varies. Is a 50-word note too small? Is 500 words too large? Context: Need guidelines for consistent atomicity without arbitrary length limits."

3. **Why Do Most Zettelkasten Systems Fail After 3 Months?**
   "Anecdotal evidence suggests high abandonment rates. Possible causes: insufficient critical mass, unclear workflow, lack of immediate ROI, poor tooling. Research needed to identify success factors."

4. **Can Atomic Notes Work for Narrative Knowledge?**
   "Atomicity suits analytical knowledge but stories have inherent structure. Can narrative knowledge be atomized without losing coherence? Or does it require different organizational principles?"

5. **How to Balance Note Creation Speed vs Quality?**
   "Perfect atomicity is slow, capturing everything risks non-atomic notes. What's the right tradeoff? Context: Need workflow that maintains quality while capturing fast enough to be sustainable."

---

### 5. CLAIM

**Definition:** Statement of belief, assertion, or hypothesis to be tested

**Purpose:** Stake out positions and beliefs worth examining

**Structure:** Declarative Statement + Scope + Falsifiability

**Key Characteristics:**

- Makes a specific, contestable assertion
- Presents a belief or hypothesis
- Falsifiable (could be proven wrong)
- Often more exploratory than arguments
- May evolve into arguments with evidence

**Linguistic Signals:**

- "I believe", "I think", "I suspect"
- "hypothesis", "assertion", "conjecture"
- Declarative statements without extensive evidence
- "seems to be", "appears that"
- "my theory is", "I propose"

**Common Structures:**

```markdown
# [Claim Statement]

**Claim:** [Clear statement of belief/hypothesis]

**Scope:** [Under what conditions this applies]

**Reasoning:** [Why I believe this]

**Falsifiability:** [What would prove this wrong]

**Status:** [Hypothesis | Under investigation | Supported | Rejected]
```

**Example Snippets:**

1. **Human Memory is Reconstructive, Not Reproductive**
   "Memories are reconstructed each time we recall them, not retrieved intact like files. This explains why memories change over time and are susceptible to suggestion. Testable through memory distortion experiments."

2. **Note Volume Matters More Than Note Quality Initially**
   "In the first year of Zettelkasten, quantity creates the network density needed for serendipity. Quality obsession early on prevents reaching critical mass. Hypothesis: 500 good-enough notes > 100 perfect notes."

3. **Folgezettel Numbers Encode Thought Sequences**
   "Luhmann's numbering system captures the evolution of ideas over time. The branching structure (1a, 1a1, 1a1b) shows how thoughts developed. This contextual information is lost in purely link-based systems."

4. **Progressive Summarization Trades Encoding for Retrieval**
   "Highlighting instead of elaborating reduces encoding depth but improves future retrieval speed. For long-term knowledge bases, this tradeoff favors retrieval. Claim requires testing against elaborative encoding."

5. **Zettelkasten Functions as Extended Cognition**
   "The note collection isn't just storage—it's an extension of thinking itself. Ideas emerge from the interaction between mind and notes. The system becomes part of your cognitive apparatus, not merely a tool."

---

### 6. PHENOMENON

**Definition:** Observed pattern, occurrence, or empirical finding

**Purpose:** Document observations and patterns for reference and analysis

**Structure:** Observation + Context + Data/Evidence

**Key Characteristics:**

- Reports what was observed or measured
- Empirical (based on observation/experience)
- Descriptive rather than explanatory
- Often includes data, metrics, or specific instances
- May later be explained by arguments or models

**Linguistic Signals:**

- "observed", "noticed", "witnessed"
- "data shows", "research found", "study demonstrated"
- "pattern", "trend", "occurrence"
- Specific numbers, dates, measurements
- "in my experience", "empirically"

**Common Structures:**

```markdown
# [Phenomenon Name/Description]

**Observation:** [What was observed]

**Context:** [When, where, under what conditions]

**Data/Evidence:** [Specific measurements, instances, examples]

**Frequency:** [How often this occurs]

**Significance:** [Why this pattern matters]
```

**Example Snippets:**

1. **Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve Shows Exponential Memory Decay**
   "Ebbinghaus (1885) documented exponential memory decay: 50% forgotten after 1 hour, 70% after 24 hours, 90% after 31 days without reinforcement. The curve is steepest immediately after learning."

2. **Note Count Acceleration After 300-Note Threshold**
   "Personal observation: Note creation accelerated from 2/week to 7/week after reaching 300 notes. Hypothesis: Network effects create positive feedback loop where existing notes spark more note creation."

3. **Luhmann's Zettelkasten Contained 90,000 Notes**
   "Niklas Luhmann's slip-box contained approximately 90,000 notes at his death. He published 70 books and 400 articles over 30 years. Productivity ratio: ~1,285 notes per published work."

4. **Linking Density Follows Power Law Distribution**
   "Analysis of my Zettelkasten: 20% of notes have 80% of the backlinks. Most notes have 1-3 backlinks, while hub notes have 20+ connections. This mirrors other network phenomena."

5. **Morning Capture Sessions Yield Different Content Types**
   "Tracking 100 capture sessions: Morning sessions produce 70% concept/question notes. Evening sessions produce 65% reflection/observation notes. Time of day correlates with note type distribution."

## Decision Tree for Type Classification

Use this decision tree to disambiguate building block types when a note could fit multiple categories:

```
1. Does the note ask a question without answering it?
   YES → QUESTION
   NO → Continue to 2

2. Does the note report an observation or empirical finding?
   YES → Is it accompanied by explanation/reasoning?
          YES → ARGUMENT (explained phenomenon)
          NO → PHENOMENON (pure observation)
   NO → Continue to 3

3. Does the note define what something IS or MEANS?
   YES → CONCEPT
   NO → Continue to 4

4. Does the note describe a system with multiple components?
   YES → MODEL
   NO → Continue to 5

5. Does the note make a claim WITH substantial evidence?
   YES → ARGUMENT
   NO → Continue to 6

6. Does the note make a claim WITHOUT substantial evidence?
   YES → CLAIM (hypothesis/belief)
   NO → Default to CONCEPT or PHENOMENON
```

## Edge Cases and Handling Strategies

### Edge Case 1: Concept vs Model

**Problem:** Large concepts may have components (e.g., "Democracy")

**Disambiguation:**

- CONCEPT: Focuses on definition and meaning
- MODEL: Focuses on components and relationships

**Example:**

- Concept: "Democracy is a system of government by the people"
- Model: "Democracy consists of: elections, representation, separation of powers, rule of law"

### Edge Case 2: Argument vs Claim

**Problem:** Both make assertions, difference is evidence depth

**Disambiguation:**

- CLAIM: Statement with minimal evidence (belief, hypothesis)
- ARGUMENT: Statement with substantial evidence and reasoning

**Rule of Thumb:** If evidence takes up >50% of note, it's an ARGUMENT

### Edge Case 3: Phenomenon vs Argument

**Problem:** Explained observations could be either

**Disambiguation:**

- PHENOMENON: Reports what happened (descriptive)
- ARGUMENT: Explains why it happened (analytical)

**Example:**

- Phenomenon: "My note count increased from 487 to 523 this month"
- Argument: "My note count increased because I implemented daily capture habits"

### Edge Case 4: Question vs Claim

**Problem:** Questions can imply claims ("Isn't X true?")

**Disambiguation:**

- QUESTION: Genuinely seeks answer, open inquiry
- CLAIM: Rhetorical question that asserts a belief

**Test:** Can you answer the question within the note? If yes, it's not a pure question.

### Edge Case 5: Concept vs Argument

**Problem:** Defining concepts can involve argumentation

**Disambiguation:**

- CONCEPT: Establishes what something means
- ARGUMENT: Defends why a claim is true

**Example:**

- Concept: "Atomic notes are notes containing one idea"
- Argument: "Atomic notes are superior to long-form notes"

### Edge Case 6: Multiple Types in One Note

**Problem:** Note contains concept definition AND argument

**Solution:** This indicates the note is NOT atomic. Fragment it:

1. Extract the concept definition into one note
2. Extract the argument into another note
3. Link them: "[[Concept]] enables [[Argument about concept]]"

## Type Frequency Expectations

Based on typical knowledge work, expect this distribution:

- **CONCEPT:** 30-35% (fundamental building blocks)
- **ARGUMENT:** 20-25% (synthesis and reasoning)
- **MODEL:** 10-15% (frameworks and systems)
- **PHENOMENON:** 15-20% (observations and data)
- **QUESTION:** 10-15% (open inquiries)
- **CLAIM:** 5-10% (hypotheses and beliefs)

Significant deviations may indicate:

- Too many concepts: Consuming more than creating
- Too many phenomena: Capturing without synthesizing
- Too many claims: Asserting without evidencing
- Too many questions: Collecting curiosity without answering

## Type Evolution Patterns

Notes often evolve through types as understanding deepens:

```
QUESTION → CLAIM → ARGUMENT → MODEL
   ↓         ↓         ↓         ↓
   └─────→ CONCEPT ←────────────┘
              ↓
         PHENOMENON (empirical testing)
```

**Example Evolution:**

1. **Question:** "How does spaced repetition work?"
2. **Claim:** "I think spaced repetition works by preventing memory decay"
3. **Phenomenon:** "I observed 80% retention with spaced practice vs 30% with cramming"
4. **Argument:** "Spaced repetition is superior because [evidence + logic]"
5. **Model:** "Spaced Repetition System consists of: scheduling algorithm, review sessions, difficulty ratings"
6. **Concept:** "Spaced Repetition is a learning technique that spaces reviews over increasing intervals"

## Usage in Structural Analysis Agent

The structural analysis agent uses this taxonomy to:

1. **Classify new notes** during atomicity analysis
2. **Validate type consistency** (does content match declared type?)
3. **Suggest fragmentation boundaries** (type shifts indicate separate ideas)
4. **Recommend related notes** based on type relationships
5. **Track type distribution** to identify knowledge work patterns
