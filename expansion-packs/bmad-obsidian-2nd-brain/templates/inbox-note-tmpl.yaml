    # Concept: Atomic Notes

    The Zettelkasten method emphasizes creating "atomic" notes - each note should
    contain exactly one idea that can stand alone. This principle enables flexible
    recombination and prevents "note bloat" where large notes become unmanageable.

    ## Context

    This concept was introduced in the context of explaining the fundamental
    principles of effective Zettelkasten note-taking.
