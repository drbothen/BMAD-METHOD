    # Temporal Evolution: [[Spaced Repetition]]

    ## Overview

    This concept evolved from a simple definition captured on 2024-01-15 to a nuanced understanding of memory consolidation algorithms over 301 days. Development shows 3 major understanding shifts and fast maturation (1.62x vault average speed).

    ## Evolution Phases

    ### Capture Phase (Jan 15-17, 2024)
    **Duration**: 2 days

    Captured from article on learning techniques. Initial note was brief definition: "Review material at increasing intervals." 3 rapid edits over 2 days articulated core idea.

    ### Development Phase (Jan 18 - Mar 10, 2024)
    **Duration**: 52 days | Edit velocity: 2.1 edits/week

    **Key milestones:**

    **Jan 20**: Promoted to evergreen (5 days after capture - fast maturation)

    **Jan 25**: First connections made to [[Forgetting Curve]] and [[Ebbinghaus Research]]

    **Feb 15**: **Understanding Shift** - Initially thought fixed intervals were optimal. After reading Wozniak's SM-2 algorithm paper, realized adaptive scheduling is superior. Added detailed notes on interval calculation.

    **Mar 5**: **Synthesis Achievement** - Connected [[Spaced Repetition]], [[Interleaving]], and [[Desirable Difficulties]] to form broader understanding of effective learning strategies.

    ### Maturation Phase (Mar 11 - Sep 15, 2024)
    **Duration**: 6 months | Link accumulation: 4.2 links/month

    Content stabilized with clear structure. Edits were refinements, not restructuring. Added to [[Learning Strategies MOC]] on Apr 5. Referenced by 12 new notes (avg 2 refs/month).

    **May 20**: **Perspective Shift** - After experimenting with Anki for 3 months, shifted from theoretical understanding to practical implementation notes. Added section on common pitfalls.

    ### Current State (Maintenance Phase)
    **As of Nov 11, 2024**

    Evergreen note serving as reference for learning strategy discussions. Rarely edited (last edit: Oct 3), but frequently referenced (28 total backlinks).

    ## Key Understanding Shifts

    ### 1. Feb 15, 2024: Contradiction

    Initially believed fixed intervals were optimal for spaced repetition. Reading Wozniak's SuperMemo SM-2 algorithm paper revealed that adaptive algorithms (which adjust intervals based on recall performance) significantly outperform fixed schedules.

    This shift represents a fundamental change in understanding. The introduction of contradictory information suggests encountering new evidence that challenged initial assumptions.

    ### 2. Mar 5, 2024: Synthesis

    Connected [[Spaced Repetition]], [[Interleaving]], and [[Desirable Difficulties]] into integrated understanding of learning strategies. Recognized these aren't isolated techniques but complementary approaches to effective memory consolidation.

    Connecting multiple related concepts demonstrates conceptual maturation. Synthesis represents moving beyond isolated facts to integrated understanding.

    ### 3. May 20, 2024: Perspective

    Shifted from theoretical knowledge (how spaced repetition works) to practical expertise (common implementation pitfalls, optimal Anki settings, realistic expectations). 3 months of hands-on experimentation transformed understanding from academic to experiential.

    This shift in perspective indicates evolving sophistication in thinking about the topic. The same content viewed through a different lens.

    ## Influences

    Key sources that shaped understanding:

    - **Wozniak, P. "SuperMemo SM-2 Algorithm"** (cited 3 times) - Introduced adaptive interval concepts
    - **Ahrens, S. "How to Take Smart Notes"** (cited 2 times) - Connected spaced repetition to broader PKM practices
    - **Personal Anki experimentation** (May-Aug 2024) - Provided practical insights beyond theory

    Additionally, personal experimentation and practical application informed perspective shifts, particularly the transition from theoretical to practical understanding.

    ## Maturation Metrics vs. Vault Average

    **Days to Evergreen**: 5 days
    - Vault Average: 18 days
    - **72% faster** ✓

    **Edit Velocity (Development Phase)**: 2.1 edits/week
    - Vault Average: 1.4 edits/week
    - **50% higher** ✓

    **Link Accumulation Rate (Maturation Phase)**: 4.2 links/month
    - Vault Average: 2.8 links/month
    - **50% higher** ✓

    **Reference Velocity**: 1.9 refs/month
    - Vault Average: 0.8 refs/month
    - **138% higher** ✓

    **Maturation Speed Index**: 1.62 (fast maturer ⚡)

    **Interpretation**: This concept matured significantly faster than vault average across all dimensions. Likely reasons: high practical relevance, clear external sources, active experimentation, and alignment with personal interests in knowledge management.

    ## Conclusion

    This concept evolved over 10 months from initial capture to current maintenance phase. Maturation to evergreen status took 5 days (72% faster than vault average).

    Development pattern shows rich conceptual evolution with 3 major understanding shifts. The note's integration into the broader knowledge network is above average (138% higher reference velocity), indicating strong foundational status in the learning strategies domain.

    **Maturation Speed Index**: 1.62 (fast maturer)

    **Recommendations**:
    - Maintain currency with quarterly reviews
    - Consider creating sub-notes for specific algorithms (SM-2, FSRS) if detail grows
    - Monitor for splitting if note exceeds 500 lines (currently healthy size)
    - Continue as reference hub for learning strategy discussions
