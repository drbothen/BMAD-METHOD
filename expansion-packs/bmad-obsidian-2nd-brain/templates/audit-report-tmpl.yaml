      ### Health Score Breakdown

      The vault health score is calculated by starting at 100 and deducting points for each quality issue:

      - **Temporal Freshness:** -10 points per 10% of notes stale
      - **Link Health:** -15 points for broken links, -5 for redirects
      - **Citation Quality:** -10 points per 10% notes with poor citations
      - **Orphan Rate:** -10 points per 5% orphaned notes
      - **Atomicity:** -15 points per 10% violations (extrapolated)
      - **Duplicates:** -10 points per duplicate group
      - **Metadata:** -10 points per 10% incomplete metadata

    *(Top 3 shown, 37 more metadata issues in full report)*

    ### Recommendation

    Add missing required metadata fields (title, created) immediately. Enhance notes with tags and type/building_block for better organization.

    ## Prioritized Action Items

    ### Critical (Fix Immediately)

    1. Fix 2 broken external links (404/403 errors)
    2. No critical metadata issues detected

    ### High Priority (Fix Soon)

    1. Update 80 stale notes that haven't been refreshed in >180 days
    2. Fix 50 notes with incomplete citations (add missing author/date fields)
    3. Add tags and type fields to 40 notes with incomplete metadata

    ### Medium Priority (Address When Possible)

    1. Update 3 redirect links to their final URLs
    2. Connect 30 orphaned notes to the knowledge graph
    3. Review 5 atomicity violations (scores 0.5-0.7) for potential cleanup
    4. Review 2 near-duplicate note pairs for consolidation

    ### Low Priority (Nice to Have)

    1. Add optional metadata fields (source, author) to enhance notes
    2. Standardize citation format across vault (consistent APA or MLA)

    ## Vault Health Metrics

    ### Health Score Breakdown

    The vault health score is calculated by starting at 100 and deducting points for each quality issue:

    - **Temporal Freshness:** -10 points per 10% of notes stale → -8 points (8% stale)
    - **Link Health:** -15 points for broken links, -5 for redirects → -0 points (2 broken links = negligible)
    - **Citation Quality:** -10 points per 10% notes with poor citations → -0 points (5% poor = negligible)
    - **Orphan Rate:** -10 points per 5% orphaned notes → -0 points (3% orphaned = negligible)
    - **Atomicity:** -15 points per 10% violations (extrapolated) → -0 points (5% violations = negligible)
    - **Duplicates:** -10 points per duplicate group → -0 points (2 groups = negligible)
    - **Metadata:** -10 points per 10% incomplete metadata → -0 points (4% incomplete = negligible)

    **Final Score:** 100 - 8 = 92 (Excellent)

    **Violations Detected (Sample):** 15 of 50 notes sampled
    **Estimated Violations (Vault-Wide):** 150
    **Average Atomicity Score:** 0.55

    ### Atomicity Scoring

    - **0.7-1.0:** Atomic (passes quality threshold)
    - **0.5-0.7:** Borderline (manual review recommended)
    - **0.0-0.5:** Non-atomic (fragmentation recommended)

    ### Violations List

    - **[SCORE: 0.25]** [[Everything I Know]] - Massive note covering 20+ unrelated topics. Urgent fragmentation needed.
    - **[SCORE: 0.38]** [[Dump File]] - Random collection of ideas with no structure.
    - **[SCORE: 0.42]** [[Mixed Topics]] - Multiple concepts tangled together.

    *(Top 3 shown, 12 more violations in full report)*

    ## Vault Health Metrics

    | Metric | Value |
    |--------|-------|
    | Total Notes | 500 |
    | Vault Health Score | 28/100 (Critical) |
    | Average Atomicity Score | 0.55 |

    ### Health Score Breakdown

    The vault health score is calculated by starting at 100 and deducting points for each quality issue:

    - **Temporal Freshness:** -10 points per 10% of notes stale → -70 points (70% stale)
    - **Link Health:** -15 points for broken links, -5 for redirects → -37.5 points (25 broken = -37.5, 15 redirects = -7.5)
    - **Citation Quality:** -10 points per 10% notes with poor citations → -40 points (40% poor citations)
    - **Orphan Rate:** -10 points per 5% orphaned notes → -60 points (30% orphaned)
    - **Atomicity:** -15 points per 10% violations (extrapolated) → -45 points (30% violations)
    - **Duplicates:** -10 points per duplicate group → -15 points (15 groups, capped at -15)
    - **Metadata:** -10 points per 10% incomplete metadata → -36 points (36% incomplete)

    **Calculation:** 100 - 70 - 37.5 - 40 - 60 - 45 - 15 - 36 = -203.5 → Floor at 0

    **Final Score:** max(0, -203.5) = 28 (after adjustment - Critical)
