  - id: content
    title: Main Content
    type: paragraphs
    instruction: |
      Insert the main note content - should contain exactly ONE complete knowledge building block.
      This is the core idea, claim, concept, or observation that makes the note atomic.
      Content should be self-contained and understandable without requiring external context.

    title: Related Concepts

    instruction: |
      Link to related atomic notes using [[WikiLink]] syntax.
      These should be LINKS ONLY, not in-depth explanations.
      If a related concept needs explanation, it should be its own atomic note.

      IMPORTANT: Only include this section if related_concepts variable is provided and not empty.
      The {{related_concepts}} variable contains a newline-separated list of links.

    condition: source_url or source_author or fragmented_from
    instruction: |
      Preserve provenance information about where this knowledge came from.
      Include original source URLs, authors, or fragmentation metadata.
      Source attribution is sacred - never lose provenance.

      IMPORTANT: Only include this section if at least one of: source_url, source_author, or fragmented_from is provided.
      Only include lines for variables that are actually provided (not null or empty).

      Format rules:
      - If source_url provided: Include "**Source:** {{source_url}}"
      - If source_author provided: Include "**Author:** {{source_author}}"
      - If fragmented_from provided: Include "**Fragmented from:** [[{{fragmented_from}}]]"
      - If fragment_number provided (only with fragmented_from): Include "**Fragment:** {{fragment_number}}"

  - id: metadata
    title: Metadata
    type: paragraphs
    condition: fragmented_from
    instruction: |
      Include fragmentation metadata if this note was created from splitting a complex note.
      This helps maintain audit trail and understand note lineage.
    template: |
      ## Metadata

      This note was created by fragmenting a non-atomic note into atomic building blocks.

    # Zettelkasten Principle - Atomicity

    The atomicity principle in Zettelkasten states that each note should contain exactly one complete idea that can stand alone. An atomic note is a single knowledge building block that is:

    1. **Self-contained** - Can be understood without extensive external context
    2. **Complete** - Contains a full thought, not a fragment
    3. **Singular** - Focuses on one concept, claim, or observation
    4. **Recombinable** - Can be linked with other atomic notes in unlimited ways

    Atomic notes prevent "note bloat" where large notes become unmanageable and enable flexible knowledge recombination through linking.

    # Spaced Repetition Superior to Massed Practice

    Spaced repetition is demonstrably superior to massed practice (cramming) for long-term retention. Evidence:

    **Thesis:** Distributing learning sessions over time produces better retention than concentrated practice.

    **Evidence:**
    1. Ebbinghaus forgetting curve shows exponential memory decay without reinforcement
    2. Multiple spaced exposures create stronger neural pathway consolidation
    3. Meta-analysis of 317 studies confirms spacing effect across domains (Cepeda et al., 2006)

    **Logic:** The brain requires time between exposures to consolidate memories from short-term to long-term storage. Massed practice creates initial encoding but lacks the retrieval practice that strengthens long-term retention.

    # PARA Method for Information Organization

    PARA is a universal system for organizing digital information into four top-level categories:

    **Components:**

    1. **Projects** - Active work with deadlines and defined outcomes
       - Example: "Launch new website by Q2"
       - Characteristic: Has a finish line

    2. **Areas** - Ongoing responsibilities with standards to maintain
       - Example: "Health & Fitness"
       - Characteristic: No end date, continuous maintenance

    3. **Resources** - Topics of ongoing interest or reference material
       - Example: "Web Development Resources"
       - Characteristic: May be useful in future

    4. **Archives** - Inactive items from the other three categories
       - Example: "Completed projects from 2024"
       - Characteristic: Cold storage for reference

    **Relationships:** Information flows from Projects → Areas → Resources → Archives as relevance decreases.

    **Boundaries:** The system is mutually exclusive (each item belongs to exactly one category) and collectively exhaustive (every item fits somewhere).
