      These should be LINKS ONLY, not in-depth explanations.
      If a related concept needs explanation, it should be its own atomic note.

      IMPORTANT: Only include this section if related_concepts variable is provided and not empty.
      The {{related_concepts}} variable contains a newline-separated list of links.

    # Zettelkasten Principle - Atomicity

    The atomicity principle in Zettelkasten states that each note should contain exactly one complete idea that can stand alone.

    ## Evidence & Context

    An atomic note is a single knowledge building block that is:

    1. **Self-contained** - Can be understood without extensive external context
    2. **Complete** - Contains a full thought, not a fragment
    3. **Singular** - Focuses on one concept, claim, or observation
    4. **Recombinable** - Can be linked with other atomic notes in unlimited ways

    Atomic notes prevent "note bloat" where large notes become unmanageable and enable flexible knowledge recombination through linking.

    # Spaced Repetition Superior to Massed Practice

    Distributing learning sessions over time produces better retention than concentrated practice (cramming).

    ## Evidence & Context

    **Evidence:**
    1. Ebbinghaus forgetting curve shows exponential memory decay without reinforcement
    2. Multiple spaced exposures create stronger neural pathway consolidation
    3. Meta-analysis of 317 studies confirms spacing effect across domains (Cepeda et al., 2006)

    **Logic:** The brain requires time between exposures to consolidate memories from short-term to long-term storage. Massed practice creates initial encoding but lacks the retrieval practice that strengthens long-term retention.

    # PARA Method for Information Organization

    PARA is a universal system for organizing digital information into four top-level categories: Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives.

    ## Evidence & Context

    **Components:**

    1. **Projects** - Active work with deadlines and defined outcomes
       - Example: "Launch new website by Q2"
       - Characteristic: Has a finish line

    2. **Areas** - Ongoing responsibilities with standards to maintain
       - Example: "Health & Fitness"
       - Characteristic: No end date, continuous maintenance

    3. **Resources** - Topics of ongoing interest or reference material
       - Example: "Web Development Resources"
       - Characteristic: May be useful in future

    4. **Archives** - Inactive items from the other three categories
       - Example: "Completed projects from 2024"
       - Characteristic: Cold storage for reference

    **Relationships:** Information flows from Projects → Areas → Resources → Archives as relevance decreases.

    **Boundaries:** The system is mutually exclusive (each item belongs to exactly one category) and collectively exhaustive (every item fits somewhere).
