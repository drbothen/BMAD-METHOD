    # Knowledge Management MOC

    ## Overview

    Knowledge management encompasses systems, practices, and philosophies for capturing, organizing, and utilizing information effectively. This MOC connects concepts from personal knowledge management (PKM), organizational KM, and cognitive science to create a comprehensive framework for working with knowledge.

    ## Core Concepts

    - [[Zettelkasten System]]: Atomic note-taking method emphasizing linking and emergence
    - [[Second Brain]]: External system for storing and processing information
    - [[PARA Method]]: Organizational framework (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives)
    - [[Evergreen Notes]]: Notes that evolve and improve over time
    - [[Building Blocks]]: Atomic units of knowledge (concepts, arguments, models, etc.)

    ## Knowledge Branches

    ### Note-Taking Systems
    Structured approaches to capturing and organizing information:
    - [[Zettelkasten System]]
    - [[Cornell Notes]]
    - [[Bullet Journaling]]

    ### Organizational Frameworks
    Methods for structuring digital information:
    - [[PARA Method]]
    - [[Johnny Decimal System]]
    - [[P.A.C.T. Framework]]

    ### Cognitive Principles
    Understanding how we learn and remember:
    - [[Spaced Repetition]]
    - [[Active Recall]]
    - [[Cognitive Load Theory]]

    ## Emerging Questions

    - How do different note-taking systems complement each other?
    - What's the optimal balance between structure and emergence?
    - How can we measure PKM system effectiveness?

    ## Last Updated

    **2025-11-06T12:00:00Z**: MOC created with foundational structure

    # Software Architecture MOC

    ## Overview

    Software architecture defines the fundamental structures of software systems, encompassing patterns, principles, and practices for designing scalable, maintainable, and robust applications. This MOC connects architectural patterns, design principles, and real-world implementation strategies.

    ## Core Concepts

    - [[Layered Architecture]]: Separation of concerns through horizontal layers
    - [[Microservices]]: Distributed architecture with independent services
    - [[Event-Driven Architecture]]: Asynchronous communication via events
    - [[Domain-Driven Design]]: Modeling software around business domains
    - [[SOLID Principles]]: Five principles for object-oriented design

    ## Knowledge Branches

    ### Architectural Patterns
    Common structural solutions:
    - [[Layered Architecture]]
    - [[Microservices Architecture]]
    - [[Event-Driven Architecture]]
    - [[Hexagonal Architecture]]

    ### Design Principles
    Foundational guidelines:
    - [[SOLID Principles]]
    - [[DRY Principle]]
    - [[YAGNI]]
    - [[Separation of Concerns]]

    ### Quality Attributes
    Non-functional requirements:
    - [[Scalability]]
    - [[Reliability]]
    - [[Maintainability]]
    - [[Performance]]

    ## Emerging Questions

    - When should monolith architectures be preferred over microservices?
    - How do we balance architectural purity with pragmatic delivery?
    - What metrics best capture architectural quality?

    ## Dynamic Content

    ```dataview
    TABLE status, building_block_type, updated
    FROM #software-architecture AND #atomic_note
    SORT updated DESC
    LIMIT 20
    ```

    ## Last Updated

    **2025-11-06T12:15:00Z**: Added dynamic Dataview query for recent notes
