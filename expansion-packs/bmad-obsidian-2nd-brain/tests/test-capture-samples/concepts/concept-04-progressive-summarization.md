Progressive summarization is a note-taking methodology that involves highlighting key passages in stages over multiple reading sessions. In other words, rather than summarizing everything at once, you progressively distill your notes through layers: first bold key sentences, then highlight critical phrases, then add your own summary at the top. This creates a visual hierarchy that makes it easy to skim notes later and quickly recall the most important points.
