Spaced repetition refers to a learning technique where information is reviewed at increasing intervals over time. This method leverages the spacing effect - the psychological phenomenon that humans remember information better when learning sessions are distributed over time rather than massed together. The optimal spacing intervals typically follow an exponential curve: 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, 14 days, 30 days, etc.
