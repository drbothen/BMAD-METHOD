The Zettelkasten method is defined as a personal knowledge management system that uses interconnected notes to build a "thinking partner" over time. Originally developed by sociologist Niklas Luhmann, the system emphasizes creating permanent notes that are linked to related concepts, allowing ideas to emerge organically through the network of connections rather than through rigid hierarchical organization.
