# PKM Systems and Learning Methods

Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) systems help you capture, organize, and retrieve information over time. Zettelkasten is one popular PKM approach that emphasizes atomic notes and linking.

The brain doesn't store information like a filing cabinet - memory is reconstructive, not reproductive. This is why spaced repetition works better than cramming. Multiple exposures spaced over time strengthen neural pathways.

When building a PKM system, you should align it with how memory actually works. For example, linking notes together mirrors how neurons form connections. The more pathways to a concept, the easier it is to retrieve.

Different PKM tools support different workflows. Obsidian uses markdown files and supports bidirectional linking. Notion uses databases and is better for project management. Roam pioneered daily notes and block-level linking.

The key is to build a system that reduces cognitive load rather than adding to it. The tool should disappear and let you focus on thinking.

## Expected Test Results

- Single Claim Test: FAIL (4+ independent claims: PKM definition, memory theory, tool comparison, cognitive load)
- Evidence Test: FAIL (memory science diverges from PKM systems, tool comparison is separate topic)
- Self-Contained Test: BORDERLINE (some terms defined, others assumed)
- Title Test: FAIL (too broad, covers 2 separate topics)
- Related Concepts Test: FAIL (explains multiple tools in depth)
- Expected score: 0.35-0.45 (NON-ATOMIC)
- Suggested remediation: Fragment into separate notes for PKM systems, memory theory, tool comparison, and cognitive load
