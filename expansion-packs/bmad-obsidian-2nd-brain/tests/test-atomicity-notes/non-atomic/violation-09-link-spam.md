# Progressive Summarization Technique

Progressive Summarization is a technique for distilling information through multiple highlighting passes. Each pass emphasizes the most important parts, creating layers of compressed meaning.

The technique involves:

1. Initial capture (layer 0)
2. Bold highlighting (layer 1)
3. Highlighted highlighting (layer 2)
4. Executive summary (layer 3)

## Expected Test Results

- Single Claim Test: PASS (one core concept: progressive summarization)
- Evidence Test: PASS (supporting details relate to main concept)
- Self-Contained Test: PASS (defines the technique)
- Title Test: PASS (descriptive)
- Related Concepts Test: PASS (just links, no in-depth explanation)
- Building Block Test: PASS (concept type)
- Completeness Test: PASS (complete explanation)
- Independence Test: PASS (self-contained)
- Link Quality Test: FAIL (critical failure - 30+ random links without meaningful relationships or context)
- Metadata Test: PASS
- Expected score: 0.4-0.5 (NON-ATOMIC - link spam degrades quality)
- Suggested remediation: Remove random links, keep only 3-5 directly related concepts with semantic relationships
