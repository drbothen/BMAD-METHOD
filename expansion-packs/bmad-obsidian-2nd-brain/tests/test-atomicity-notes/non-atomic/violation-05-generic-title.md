# Thoughts on Note-Taking

I've been thinking about how to take better notes. The main issue I've noticed is that my notes are too scattered and I can't find things later.

Some ideas:
- Use consistent tags
- Write in my own words instead of copying quotes
- Link related notes together
- Review notes regularly instead of writing and forgetting

I read somewhere that the best note-taking systems are the ones you actually use. So I'm trying to keep things simple rather than building a complex system I'll abandon.

Also considering whether to use folders or tags for organization. Tags seem more flexible but folders are more familiar.

The key is probably to just start and iterate. Perfect is the enemy of good.

## Expected Test Results
- Single Claim Test: FAIL (multiple unrelated ideas: scattered notes, tagging, folders vs tags, perfect is enemy of good)
- Evidence Test: FAIL (no cohesive argument, just random observations)
- Self-Contained Test: PASS (no undefined terms)
- Title Test: FAIL (extremely generic "Thoughts on Note-Taking" - could apply to any note-taking topic)
- Related Concepts Test: PASS (no in-depth explanations)
- Expected score: 0.4-0.5 (NON-ATOMIC)
- Suggested remediation: Fragment into focused notes OR choose one clear claim and develop it, create specific descriptive title
