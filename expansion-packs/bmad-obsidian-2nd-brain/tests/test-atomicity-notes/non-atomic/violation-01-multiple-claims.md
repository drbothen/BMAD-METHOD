# Notes on Productivity Systems

Zettelkasten uses atomic notes to build a second brain. Each note contains exactly one idea, which enables flexible recombination and emergent insights.

GTD (Getting Things Done) uses context lists to organize actions. You sort tasks by @computer, @phone, @errands so you can batch similar activities together.

PARA method divides information into Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives. This creates a clear organizational structure.

Time-blocking assigns specific time slots to tasks. Cal Newport advocates for this approach in Deep Work.

The Pomodoro Technique uses 25-minute focused work sessions followed by 5-minute breaks.

## Expected Test Results

- Single Claim Test: FAIL (5 independent claims: Zettelkasten, GTD, PARA, Time-blocking, Pomodoro)
- Evidence Test: FAIL (each "claim" is actually a separate topic)
- Self-Contained Test: FAIL (undefined terms: "second brain", "context lists", assumes knowledge of GTD/PARA)
- Title Test: FAIL (too generic, not descriptive)
- Related Concepts Test: PASS (no in-depth explanations)
- Expected score: 0.3-0.4 (NON-ATOMIC)
- Suggested remediation: Fragment into 5 separate notes
