# Using PARA for My Second Brain

I've been organizing my PKM system using P.A.R.A. categories and it's really helping clean up my notes. The key insight is separating Projects from Areas - I had been mixing them together before.

My Projects folder now contains only active work with deadlines. I moved all my ongoing Areas into a separate folder. Resources is where I keep my MOCs and reference material.

The CODE workflow integrates nicely with PARA. I Capture everything in my inbox, then Organize it into PARA categories during my weekly review. Distill happens gradually as I refine notes, and Express is when I publish or share the work.

I'm also using Obsidian's YAML frontmatter to track which PARA category each note belongs to. This makes it easy to query and reorganize later.

## Expected Test Results

- Single Claim Test: PASS (one main claim about organizing with PARA)
- Evidence Test: PASS (evidence relates to main claim)
- Self-Contained Test: FAIL (undefined: PARA, PKM, MOCs, CODE, "second brain", assumes prior knowledge)
- Title Test: FAIL (personal narrative "My Second Brain" not clear/generic)
- Related Concepts Test: FAIL (mentions CODE, Obsidian without explanation)
- Expected score: 0.5-0.6 (BORDERLINE/NON-ATOMIC)
- Suggested remediation: Define all acronyms, add context about what PARA/CODE are, remove personal narrative framing
