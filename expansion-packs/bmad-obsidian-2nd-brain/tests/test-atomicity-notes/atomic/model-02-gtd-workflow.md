# GTD Five-Step Workflow Model

Getting Things Done (GTD) organizes all work through five sequential steps: Capture, Clarify, Organize, Reflect, and Engage.

**System Components:**

1. **Capture:** Collect everything that has your attention in trusted external systems (inbox, notes, voice memos)
2. **Clarify:** Process each item - is it actionable? If yes, what's the next physical action? If no, trash/reference/someday
3. **Organize:** Put clarified items in the right places (calendar for time-specific, next actions list, waiting-for list, project plans)
4. **Reflect:** Review your system regularly (daily, weekly) to stay current and make trusted choices
5. **Engage:** Choose actions based on context, time available, energy level, and priority

**Relationships:**

- Steps are sequential: items flow from Capture → Clarify → Organize
- Reflect loops back to all steps, ensuring system integrity
- Engage pulls from Organize based on current circumstances
- The system is closed-loop: everything captured must be processed

**Boundaries:**

- Only capture things requiring action or decision
- Each step must be completed before moving to the next
- Engage only acts on already-clarified and organized items
