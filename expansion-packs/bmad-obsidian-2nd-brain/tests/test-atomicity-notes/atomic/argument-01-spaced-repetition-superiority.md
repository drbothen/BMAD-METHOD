# Spaced Repetition is Superior to Massed Practice for Long-Term Retention

Spaced repetition is more effective than massed practice (cramming) for long-term memory retention. This has been consistently demonstrated across multiple studies and is rooted in how memory consolidation works.

**Evidence:**

1. The Ebbinghaus forgetting curve shows that memory decays exponentially without review. Spaced repetition combats this decay by strategically timing reviews just as memory begins to fade.

2. Research by Cepeda et al. (2006) meta-analyzed 317 experiments and found that spaced practice produced better retention than massed practice in 259 of them (82%).

3. Neurologically, spaced repetition strengthens neural pathways through repeated activation with rest periods, allowing for better memory consolidation during sleep.

**Conclusion:** For anyone seeking long-term retention of information, spaced repetition should be the default learning strategy rather than massed practice.
