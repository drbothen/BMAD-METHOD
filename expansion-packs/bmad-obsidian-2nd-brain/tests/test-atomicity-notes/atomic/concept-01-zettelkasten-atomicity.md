# Zettelkasten Principle - Atomicity

Each note in a Zettelkasten should contain exactly one complete knowledge building block. This atomicity principle means that every note expresses a single concept, argument, or observation that can stand alone and be understood without requiring extensive external context.

Atomic notes enable flexible recombination because each note is an independent unit. When notes are atomic, they can be linked in unlimited ways to create new connections and insights. This is the foundation of emergent thinking in a Zettelkasten system.
