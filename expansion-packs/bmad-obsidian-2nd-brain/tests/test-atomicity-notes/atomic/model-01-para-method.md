# PARA Method for Information Organization

PARA is a comprehensive organizational framework that divides all information into four categories: Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives.

**System Components:**

1. **Projects:** Short-term efforts with specific goals and deadlines (e.g., "Launch new website by Q2")
2. **Areas:** Ongoing responsibilities requiring maintenance over time (e.g., "Health", "Finances")
3. **Resources:** Topics of ongoing interest or reference materials (e.g., "Machine Learning", "Recipes")
4. **Archives:** Inactive items from the above three categories

**Relationships:**

- Projects are derived from Areas (ongoing responsibilities generate specific projects)
- Resources support both Projects and Areas with reference information
- Everything eventually flows to Archives when no longer active
- The system is hierarchical but flexible: items can move between categories as their status changes

**Boundaries:**

- Only active work lives in Projects/Areas/Resources
- Completed or inactive items must move to Archives
- Each item belongs to exactly one category at a time
