# Human Memory is Reconstructive, Not Reproductive

I assert that human memory does not work like a video recording that can be played back with perfect fidelity. Instead, memories are actively reconstructed each time we recall them, influenced by our current context, beliefs, and expectations.

**Scope:**
This claim applies to episodic memory (memories of events and experiences), not to procedural memory (motor skills) or semantic memory (factual knowledge), which may operate differently.

**Falsifiability:**
This claim could be falsified if research demonstrated that episodic memories are stored as complete, immutable records that are retrieved without alteration. However, decades of research in cognitive psychology support the reconstructive view.

**Implications:**
- Eyewitness testimony is inherently unreliable
- Memories can be altered by suggestion or misinformation
- The act of remembering changes the memory itself

## Test Validation Criteria
- ✓ Single claim: Clear assertion stated upfront
- ✓ Evidence: Scope and falsifiability support the claim without introducing new topics
- ✓ Self-contained: Defines reconstructive vs reproductive
- ✓ Title: Declarative, specific claim
- ✓ Related concepts: None requiring explanation
- Expected score: >= 0.85
