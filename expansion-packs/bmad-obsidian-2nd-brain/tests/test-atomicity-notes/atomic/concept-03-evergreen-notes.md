# Evergreen Notes - Densely Linked Permanent Notes

Evergreen notes are permanent notes in a knowledge management system that evolve over time through continuous refinement and linking. Unlike fleeting notes or literature notes, evergreen notes are designed to grow and develop as your understanding deepens.

The term "evergreen" captures two essential qualities: these notes are permanent (they don't decay or become obsolete) and they grow (accumulating more connections and nuance over time). They are the opposite of disposable notes or temporary captures.

Characteristics of evergreen notes:
- Atomic: one concept per note
- Concept-oriented: titled by concepts, not sources
- Densely linked: connected to many related notes
- Written in your own words: not mere quotations
- Designed for longevity: not time-bound or context-dependent
