# Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve Shows Exponential Memory Decay

Hermann Ebbinghaus documented a consistent pattern in 1885: human memory retention decreases exponentially over time without reinforcement. This observed phenomenon shows that we forget approximately:

- 50% of new information within 1 hour
- 70% within 24 hours
- 90% within 1 week

**Empirical Context:**
Ebbinghaus discovered this pattern through self-experimentation using nonsense syllables (e.g., "WID", "ZOF") to eliminate the confounding variable of prior knowledge or meaning. He tested himself repeatedly and recorded retention rates over time.

**Pattern Characteristics:**

- The decay follows an exponential curve, not a linear decline
- The steepest drop occurs in the first hour after learning
- The curve flattens after several days but never reaches zero
- The pattern is remarkably consistent across individuals and types of material

**Repeatability:**
This phenomenon has been replicated in hundreds of studies since 1885 and holds across different populations, age groups, and types of information (though meaningful information is retained better than nonsense syllables).

## Test Validation Criteria

- ✓ Single claim: One observed pattern (exponential decay)
- ✓ Evidence: All details describe the phenomenon, no divergent topics
- ✓ Self-contained: Explains who, what, when, how
- ✓ Title: Descriptive of the phenomenon
- ✓ Related concepts: None requiring separate explanation
- Expected score: >= 0.9
