# Bidirectional Links in Knowledge Management

Bidirectional links are connections between notes that work in both directions automatically. When Note A links to Note B, Note B shows a backlink to Note A without requiring manual creation.

This concept is fundamental to networked thinking because it reveals unexpected connections. Traditional hierarchical systems create one-way parent-child relationships, but bidirectional links create a web where any note can connect to any other note in multiple ways.

The power of bidirectional linking emerges when you discover that Note C and Note D both link to Note B. This reveals an implicit relationship between C and D that you might not have noticed otherwise. The backlink panel becomes a discovery tool, not just a navigation aid.
