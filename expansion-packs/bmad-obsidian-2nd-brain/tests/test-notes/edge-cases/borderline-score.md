# Spaced Repetition and Active Recall

Spaced repetition improves long-term retention by distributing learning sessions over time. The Ebbinghaus forgetting curve shows that we forget exponentially without review.

Active recall strengthens memory by forcing retrieval practice. Instead of passively re-reading, you actively try to remember the information.

## Test Expectations

**Expected atomicity analysis:**

- is_atomic: borderline (could go either way)
- score: 0.6-0.7 (borderline range)
- building_block_type: concept or argument
- violations: ["Multiple independent claims detected" OR "Related concepts explained in-depth"]
- verdict: BORDERLINE or NON-ATOMIC

**Reasoning:**
This is a borderline case because:

- Two related but distinct concepts (spaced repetition vs active recall)
- Could argue they're a single "learning technique" concept
- Or could argue they're separate ideas requiring fragmentation
- Human reviewers might disagree on atomicity

**Fragmentation decision:**
Should probably fragment into:

1. "Spaced Repetition for Long-Term Retention" (concept)
2. "Active Recall as Retrieval Practice" (concept)

With cross-links showing they're complementary learning techniques.
