# Zettelkasten Principle - Atomicity

The atomicity principle in Zettelkasten states that each note should contain exactly one complete idea that can stand alone. An atomic note is a single knowledge building block that is:

1. **Self-contained** - Can be understood without extensive external context
2. **Complete** - Contains a full thought, not a fragment
3. **Singular** - Focuses on one concept, claim, or observation
4. **Recombinable** - Can be linked with other atomic notes in unlimited ways

Atomic notes prevent "note bloat" where large notes become unmanageable and enable flexible knowledge recombination through linking.
