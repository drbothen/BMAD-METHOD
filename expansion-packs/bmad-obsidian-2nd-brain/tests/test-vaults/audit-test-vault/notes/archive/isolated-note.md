# Isolated Note

**WARNING: This is an ORPHANED note**

This note has:

- **Zero incoming links** (no other notes link to this)
- **Zero outgoing links** (this note doesn't link to any others)
- Completely disconnected from the knowledge graph

## Content

This note exists in isolation. It was created during a brainstorming session but never integrated into the main knowledge base.

## Characteristics for Testing

- `orphan_status`: true
- `incoming_link_count`: 0
- `outgoing_link_count`: 0
- `suggested_links`: Should be generated by semantic search
  - Potential links to methodology, framework, or workflow
  - Based on content similarity

**Test Validation:**

- Should appear in orphaned notes list
- Should have suggested linking opportunities (if semantic search available)
- Low priority for freshness (no importance score)
