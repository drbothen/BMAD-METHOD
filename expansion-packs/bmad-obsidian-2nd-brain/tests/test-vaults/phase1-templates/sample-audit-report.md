# Vault Audit Report - My Second Brain

## Executive Summary

Overall vault health: **Good (78/100)**. The vault demonstrates solid knowledge management practices with 487 notes and an average link density of 4.2 links per note. Critical issues identified include 3 broken external links in frequently-referenced notes and 12 notes (2.5%) that are stale (>180 days without updates) in active knowledge domains. Orphaned notes remain low at 5.3% (26 notes), indicating healthy graph connectivity. Recommended immediate action: fix broken links in high-traffic notes and review stale notes in the "Learning Science" domain.

## Temporal Freshness Issues

**Stale Notes:** 12 notes (2.5% of vault)
**Threshold:** 180 days

**Critical Priority:**

- **[[Cognitive Load Theory]]** - 247 days stale
  - Referenced by 8 other notes
  - Core concept in Learning Science MOC
  - Recommendation: Review recent research, update examples

- **[[Transfer of Learning]]** - 223 days stale
  - Referenced by 5 other notes
  - Key principle for skill development
  - Recommendation: Add recent case studies

**High Priority:**

- **[[Spaced Repetition Systems]]** - 195 days stale
- **[[Metacognitive Strategies]]** - 187 days stale
- **[[Working Memory Capacity]]** - 184 days stale

## Link Validation Issues

**Broken Links (4xx):** 3
**Redirects (3xx):** 5
**Timeouts:** 1

**Critical - Broken Links:**

- **404 Not Found** in [[Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve]]
  - URL: https://old-psychology-journal.com/article/123 (archived)
  - Suggestion: Replace with https://archive.org/... or current journal URL

- **404 Not Found** in [[Active Recall Research]]
  - URL: https://university-site.edu/paper.pdf (moved)
  - Suggestion: Search DOI or contact author for new location

**Redirects Needing Update:**

- **301 Permanent Redirect** in [[Learning Styles Myth]]
  - Old: http://example.com/learning-styles
  - New: https://example.com/debunking-learning-styles
  - Action: Update link to new URL

## Source Validation Issues

**Citation Issues:** 18 notes (3.7% of vault)
**Citation Coverage:** 96.3%

**Unattributed Claims:**

- [[Desirable Difficulties]] - Contains assertions about testing effects without source
- [[Interleaving Benefits]] - Claims about math learning lack attribution

**Incomplete Citations:**

- [[Dual Coding Theory]] - Source listed without date or author
- [[Deliberate Practice]] - Book reference missing page numbers

## Orphaned Notes

**Orphaned Notes:** 26 notes (5.3% of vault)

| Note | Created | Modified | Length | Action |
|------|---------|----------|--------|--------|
| [[Random Observation About Focus]] | 2025-09-12 | 2025-09-12 | 145 words | Link or Archive |
| [[Meeting Notes 2025-08-15]] | 2025-08-15 | 2025-08-15 | 89 words | Archive |
| [[Quick Thought on Memory]] | 2025-07-22 | 2025-07-22 | 52 words | Delete or Expand |

*Showing 3 of 26 orphaned notes*

**Recommendations:**
- Review orphans created >90 days ago for archival
- Expand notes <100 words or merge into related notes
- Create MOC links for domain-relevant orphans

## Atomicity Violations

**Sample Size:** 50 notes analyzed
**Violations Found:** 7 notes (14% of sample)
**Estimated Vault-Wide:** ~68 notes (14% of 487)
**Average Atomicity Score:** 0.82

**High-Priority Violations:**

- **[[PKM Systems Overview]]** (atomicity: 0.42)
  - Contains 5 distinct concepts: Zettelkasten, PARA, GTD, Second Brain, Cornell Notes
  - Recommendation: Fragment into individual atomic notes

- **[[Learning Theory Collection]]** (atomicity: 0.38)
  - Mixed concepts from behaviorism, cognitivism, constructivism
  - Recommendation: Create "Learning Theories MOC" and separate notes

## Duplicate Content

**Duplicate Groups:** 2 groups detected

**Group 1: Spaced Repetition** (similarity: 0.87)
- [[Spaced Repetition Basics]]
- [[How Spaced Repetition Works]]
- Recommendation: Merge into single authoritative note, redirect links

## Metadata Completeness
