# Learning Science MOC

## Overview

Learning science synthesizes insights from cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and educational research to understand how humans acquire, retain, and apply knowledge. This MOC connects evidence-based learning strategies, cognitive principles, and practical techniques for effective learning and teaching.

## Core Concepts

- [[Spaced Repetition]]: Distributing learning sessions over time for better retention
- [[Active Recall]]: Retrieving information from memory strengthens learning
- [[Elaborative Rehearsal]]: Connecting new information to existing knowledge
- [[Cognitive Load Theory]]: Managing mental effort to optimize learning
- [[Metacognition]]: Awareness and regulation of one's own thinking processes
- [[Feynman Technique]]: Teaching concepts simply to expose understanding gaps

## Knowledge Branches

### Memory Systems

How information is encoded, stored, and retrieved:

- [[Working Memory]]
- [[Long-Term Memory]]
- [[Episodic Memory]]
- [[Semantic Memory]]

### Learning Strategies

Evidence-based techniques for effective learning:

- [[Spaced Repetition]]
- [[Interleaving Practice]]
- [[Retrieval Practice]]
- [[Elaborative Interrogation]]

### Cognitive Principles

Fundamental insights about how the brain learns:

- [[Cognitive Load Theory]]
- [[Dual Coding Theory]]
- [[Transfer of Learning]]
- [[Desirable Difficulties]]

### Application Methods

Practical frameworks and systems:

- [[Feynman Technique]]
- [[Cornell Note-Taking]]
- [[SQ3R Reading Method]]
- [[Zettelkasten System]]

## Emerging Questions

- How do individual differences (cognitive style, prior knowledge) affect optimal learning strategies?
- What's the relationship between motivation and learning effectiveness?
- How can we measure learning progress beyond traditional testing?
- What role does sleep play in memory consolidation?
