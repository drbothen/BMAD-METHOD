# Query Results

**Query:** "How does spaced repetition improve retention?"
**Intent:** factual (confidence: 0.92)
**Results:** 5 notes found
**Duration:** 142ms

## Results

### Highly Relevant (score >= 0.8)

- **[[Spaced Repetition Superior to Massed Practice]]** (0.95)
  - Distributing learning sessions over time produces better retention than concentrated practice (cramming). Meta-analysis of 317 studies confirms spacing effect across domains.
  - _Sources: Obsidian Full-Text, Neo4j Graph | Created: 2025-11-05_

- **[[Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve]]** (0.88)
  - Memory retention decays exponentially without reinforcement. Spaced repetition counters this by scheduling reviews just before predicted forgetting.

### Relevant (score >= 0.6)

- **[[Active Recall]]** (0.72)
  - Retrieving information from memory (rather than re-reading) strengthens retention. Spaced repetition combines this with optimal timing.
  - _Sources: Obsidian Full-Text_

- **[[Anki Flashcard System]]** (0.68)
  - Practical implementation of spaced repetition using SuperMemo algorithm. Automatically schedules cards based on recall performance.

### Somewhat Relevant (score >= 0.4)

- **[[Cognitive Load Theory]]** (0.55)
  - Spacing learning reduces cognitive load by allowing time for consolidation between sessions.
