# Feynman Technique for Understanding

The Feynman Technique is a learning method where you explain a concept in simple language as if teaching it to someone unfamiliar with the topic, revealing gaps in your understanding.

## Evidence & Context

**Process:**

1. **Choose a concept** - Select the topic you want to understand
2. **Teach it to a child** - Explain using simple language and examples
3. **Identify gaps** - Note where explanation breaks down or requires jargon
4. **Review and simplify** - Go back to source material and refine explanation
5. **Organize and tell a story** - Create a coherent narrative using analogies

**Why it works:**

- Forces active retrieval rather than passive review
- Exposes illusion of competence (thinking you know when you don't)
- Simplification reveals true understanding versus memorization
- Analogies create mental models that aid retention
